i have a project idea to make an llk parser for a snippet engine

---

Excellent idea ‚Äî an **LL(k) parser for a snippet engine** is a powerful and flexible foundation that can support nested, templated, and logic-based snippet definitions while remaining fast and predictable.

Let‚Äôs walk through a **structured plan** for designing and implementing it, with all the key fundamentals, architectural considerations, and extensibility points.

---

## üß© 1. Core Concept

An **LL(k) parser** (Left-to-right, Leftmost derivation, k-token lookahead) is ideal for:

- **Predictable** parsing (deterministic and efficient)
- **Readable** grammars (matches snippet DSLs that look like HTML or structured text)
- **Real-time** parsing (excellent for editors or live AST reloading)
- **Extensible** constructs (e.g., conditionals, mirrors, tabstops)

Your snippet engine will parse a **snippet DSL**, something like:

‚Ä¶and transform it into an AST for runtime expansion, editing, and mirroring.

---

## üß± 2. Core Architecture Overview

### Diagram

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Pipeline Components

### 3.1 Tokenizer (Lexer)

- Splits input into atomic units.
- Keeps **source position info** for traceability.
- Should be **context-aware** (e.g. inside `${...}` or `<if>`).

**Example tokens:**

| Token Type | Example Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TAG\_OPEN | `<snippet` | Start of a tag |
| TAG\_CLOSE | `>` | End of a tag |
| IDENT | `snippet` | Identifier |
| TEXT | `hello world` | Raw snippet text |
| PLACEHOLDER | `${1:name}` | Tabstop placeholder |
| LOGIC\_OPEN | `<if condition="...">` | Control structure |
| LOGIC\_CLOSE | `</if>` | Control end |

You can use **Superpower** or a custom span-based lexer for.NET.

---

### 3.2 LL(k) Parser

- Consumes tokens using a **predictive parsing table** or recursive descent.
- Handles **lookahead (k)** for resolving ambiguity (e.g., `<if>` vs `<identifier>`).
- Produces **typed nodes** in the AST.

**Example Grammar (simplified):**

---

### 3.3 AST Model

Each AST node should be typed, serializable, and human-readable.

**Example:**

---

### 3.4 Evaluator & Renderer

- Walks the AST and substitutes placeholders, mirrors, and conditions.
- Optionally re-hydrates snippets from AST ‚Üí text for editor syncing.

**Logic handling options:**

- Hardcoded condition evaluation (`if`, `else`, etc.)
- Plug-in evaluator (e.g. using expression parser)
- Context-aware (e.g. snippet variables, system context)

---

## üß† 4. LL(k) Parsing Strategy

**Key choice:**  
You can implement LL(k) manually or generate it.

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recursive Descent | Handwritten parser | Easy to debug, flexible | Verbose | Build generator helpers |
| Parser Table | Precomputed table from grammar | Fast | Harder to maintain manually | Build generator or tooling |
| Hybrid (LL(2) typical) | Minimal lookahead manually handled | Simple for DSLs | Limited k-depth | Use 2-token lookahead only |

For a snippet engine, **Recursive Descent LL(2)** is perfect.

---

## üß© 5. Error Handling & Recovery

Use **panic mode** or **synchronization tokens** (`</snippet>`, `</if>`, etc.)  
Provide **precise errors with source spans**.

**Example:**

---

## üîå 6. Extensibility Design

Your parser should support **plugin-defined nodes**.

### Example plugin model:

Then discovered dynamically with reflection at startup.

---

## üßÆ 7. Performance Tips

| Technique | Benefit |
| --- | --- |
| Span-based lexing (`ReadOnlySpan<char>`) | No string allocations |
| Reuse token objects | Reduced GC pressure |
| Use struct-based `Token` | Cache locality |
| Short-circuit parsing when confident | Speed |
| Pre-tokenize for multiple passes | Efficiency |

---

## ‚ö° 8. Pros, Cons, and Solutions

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic and fast parsing | Harder to handle ambiguity | Restrict grammar and use lookahead |
| Easy to debug | Manual code growth | Generate parser helpers |
| Great for IDE use | Poor for left recursion | Rewrite grammar to be right-recursive |

---

## üîß 9. Development Plan (Step-by-Step)

| Step | Task | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Define grammar (EBNF or BNF) | Keep small and clean |
| 2 | Implement tokenizer | Include position tracking |
| 3 | Implement LL(2) parser | Recursive descent preferred |
| 4 | Create AST node types | Typed record structures |
| 5 | Implement evaluator | With plugin support |
| 6 | Add error recovery | Source-based reporting |
| 7 | Add test suite | For all snippet patterns |
| 8 | Integrate editor runtime | e.g., Scintilla, Monaco, etc. |

---

## üß≠ 10. Future Expansions

- **Logic integration:** Embed expression evaluation (`<if condition="user.loggedIn">`)
- **Macro expansion:** Inline reusable snippets
- **Context binding:** Resolve variables from runtime (e.g. project name)
- **Graph visualization:** AST or dependency visualization for debugging
- **Hot reload:** Re-parse snippets on file change

---

Would you like me to write the **LL(2) recursive descent pseudocode** for this snippet engine grammar next (including placeholders and `<if>` tags)?  
That would give you a ready base to start implementing it in C#.

---

i want to make the snippet language like vscodes but more extendable so there can be functions as well as for loops, switch statements, etc, in the snippets instead of just basic choices and variables, i also want users to be able to define variables instead of just relying on the supplied variables; the llk parser is essentially just for handling nested variables in variables recursively, but there are other pros to take advantage of also; and i want to use the tree structure for larger scale edits also, etc

---

Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs a **powerful and scalable vision** for a snippet system: essentially a *‚Äúprogrammable snippet language‚Äù* that blends **VSCode-style snippet syntax** with **scripting and logic features**.  
You‚Äôre absolutely right: an **LL(k) parser** is *exactly* what you want for that ‚Äî predictable, human-readable, and recursive enough to handle variable nesting, tree transforms, and extendable language constructs.

Let‚Äôs design the system around your intent.

---

## üß© 1. Vision Overview

You‚Äôre not just building a snippet system ‚Äî you‚Äôre building a **Snippet DSL** with logic, structure, and composability.

### üß† Goal Summary

| Capability | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Extend VSCode Syntax** | Support `${1:name}` and `${VAR:default}` | `${userName:Guest}` |
| **User-Defined Variables** | Declare inside snippet or imported scope | `@var projectName = "AIEngine"` |
| **Functions / Logic Blocks** | Allow `<if>`, `<for>`, `<switch>` etc. | `<if user.isAdmin>Welcome ${user.name}</if>` |
| **Nested Variable Expansion** | Recursive substitutions | `${greeting${lang}}` |
| **Tree-Based Editing** | AST reflects editor content for large-scale refactors | Rename variable ‚Üí updates all mirrors |
| **Plugin Nodes** | Add custom constructs like `<fetch>`, `<date>`, `<query>` | `<date format="yyyy-MM-dd"/>` |

---

## üß± 2. Architectural Blueprint

Your parser is the **foundation** of an entire **snippet engine ecosystem**:

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Language Features (Core + Extensions)

### 3.1 Variable Declaration

### 3.2 Inline Variable Interpolation

### 3.3 Logic Blocks

### 3.4 Iteration

### 3.5 Switch / Case

### 3.6 Functions

---

## üå≤ 4. Why LL(k) Fits Perfectly

An **LL(k) parser** allows you to:

| Advantage | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Predictive parsing** | You can know how to parse `<if>` vs `<identifier>` from next token | `<if ...>` |
| **Nested constructs** | Handle `${${nested}}` cleanly with recursion | `${outer${inner}}` |
| **Lookahead (k>1)** | Differentiate between `<case>` and `<default>` | `<case "value">` |
| **Readable grammar** | Easier to extend and debug for new features | Add `<match>` or `<import>` later |
| **Tree-based refactor support** | Direct link between AST nodes and editor spans | Enables programmatic edits |

---

## üßÆ 5. Grammar Design (LL(2) Candidate)

Below is a *starting grammar* (simplified LL(2) pseudocode/BNF):

```markdown
mathematicaProgram           ‚Üí Statement*
Statement         ‚Üí VarDecl | FuncDecl | SnippetElement

VarDecl           ‚Üí "@var" IDENT "=" Expression
FuncDecl          ‚Üí "@func" IDENT "(" ArgList? ")" Block "@endfunc"
SnippetElement    ‚Üí Text | Placeholder | IfBlock | ForBlock | SwitchBlock | Call | Tag

Placeholder       ‚Üí "${" IDENT (":" Expression)? "}"
IfBlock           ‚Üí "<if" Expression ">" Program (ElseBlock)? "</if>"
ElseBlock         ‚Üí "<else>" Program
ForBlock          ‚Üí "<for" IDENT "in" Expression ">" Program "</for>"
SwitchBlock       ‚Üí "<switch" Expression ">" CaseBlock* DefaultBlock? "</switch>"
CaseBlock         ‚Üí "<case" Literal ">" Program
DefaultBlock      ‚Üí "<default>" Program
Call              ‚Üí "${" IDENT "(" ArgList? ")" "}"
Expression        ‚Üí Literal | IDENT | FunctionCall | NestedVar
NestedVar         ‚Üí "${" IDENT (":" Expression)? "}"
Literal           ‚Üí STRING | NUMBER | BOOLEAN
ArgList           ‚Üí Expression ("," Expression)*
Block             ‚Üí Program
```

‚úÖ This grammar:

- Supports **recursive variable expansion**
- Handles **logic and iteration**
- Allows **function definitions and invocations**
- Fits **LL(2)** easily (limited ambiguity)

---

## üß† 6. AST Tree Design

Your **AST** should model all major constructs cleanly.

---

## üß∞ 7. Variable & Scope Management

Use a **hierarchical variable registry**:

When evaluating, scopes stack:

---

## üîå 8. Plugin & Extensibility Model

Plugins can register new tags or expressions dynamically.

Registered via reflection:

---

## üß† 9. Tree-Based Editing & Transformation

Once you have the AST, you can:

- Traverse and **edit variable names** programmatically.
- Apply **bulk text transformations** without regex.
- Build **semantic search** (e.g., find all `${projectName}` mirrors).
- Re-serialize back to text after edits.

For instance:

---

## ‚ö° 10. Implementation Phases (Recommended Order)

| Phase | Component | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Tokenizer** | Lexical rules for tags, placeholders, variables |
| 2 | **LL(2) Parser** | Grammar-based recursive descent |
| 3 | **AST Builder** | Tree construction |
| 4 | **Evaluator** | Variable/logic resolution |
| 5 | **Runtime Context** | Variable scopes, plugin registry |
| 6 | **Renderer** | To text, or to structured editor view |
| 7 | **Tree Transformer API** | Edits, mirroring, refactors |
| 8 | **Plugin Loader** | External extensions |
| 9 | **Testing & Validation** | Grammar edge cases, nested recursion |

---

## üßÆ 11. Pros, Cons, and Solutions

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extendable, readable DSL | Potential for grammar conflicts | Use LL(2) and restrict ambiguous forms |
| Ideal for live editors | Parser may grow complex | Build modular grammar components |
| Tree-based editing | AST sync requires effort | Add Span tracking to all nodes |
| Plugin power | Versioning of plugins | Use semantic versioning in registry |

---

## üß≠ 12. Summary

You‚Äôre building an **LL(k)-based programmable snippet language**, that will:

- Parse recursively nested variables
- Allow embedded logic and flow control
- Support dynamic variable definitions and scoping
- Build a manipulable AST for editing and transformations
- Be extensible through plugin nodes and runtime functions

---

Would you like me to next:

1. Write **the full LL(2) recursive descent pseudocode** for the grammar above (with tokenizer rules included), or
2. Design **the runtime evaluator and variable scoping model** that runs the parsed AST?

Either is a perfect next step.

---

instead of the ${#:x} format, i want it to be html tag based, that will mean that we cant template html, but we already have reacrt, vue, etc, so it doesnt mean much

---

That‚Äôs actually a **very elegant and forward-thinking choice.**  
Switching from `${}` -based placeholders to **HTML-tag‚Äìbased snippet syntax** makes the language **cleaner**, **more composable**, and **far easier to extend** ‚Äî especially when your snippets are meant to represent structured, logic-aware templates, not raw text insertions.

You're effectively evolving from:

to something more like:

Let‚Äôs go over this design in depth, because it gives you **a huge number of structural and architectural advantages** ‚Äî particularly when building an **LL(k) parser** and **tree-based editor**.

---

## üß© 1. Core Design Shift

### üß† Old (VSCode-like)

### üß± New (Tag-based)

**Key differences:**

| Feature | VSCode-style | Tag-based |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syntax | `${}` inline text | XML-like markup |
| Grammar complexity | Contextual (string parsing needed) | Well-formed LL(k)-parsable |
| Nesting | Hard (regex hell) | Easy (recursive node tree) |
| Extendability | Limited to `${choice}` and `${var}` | Unlimited (`<if>`, `<for>`, `<func>`, `<macro>`, etc.) |
| Parser type | Token-based string substitution | Structural grammar with predictable nodes |
| Editing | Difficult (regex + string replace) | Tree-based, semantic-aware edits |

---

## üß± 2. Example DSL Evolution

Let‚Äôs define some **canonical examples** using this HTML-tag model.

---

### ‚úÖ Basic placeholders

### ‚úÖ Choices

### ‚úÖ Mirrors

### ‚úÖ Variables

### ‚úÖ Logic

### ‚úÖ Loops

### ‚úÖ Functions

---

## üß† 3. LL(k) Grammar (Tag-based Form)

The LL(k) grammar becomes extremely clean, fully compatible with recursive descent parsing:

Then, the **TagName** can be specialized into snippet constructs:

This grammar is **LL(1)** in most cases and **LL(2)** only for `if/else` and similar constructs.

---

## üå≤ 4. AST Design (Simplified)

The AST mirrors the XML structure and becomes perfect for tree-based manipulation.

Then later, you can *specialize* tags:

---

## üß© 5. Why This Is Superior for LL(k)

| LL(k) Benefit | Description | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Predictable nesting** | Each `<tag>` has a clear open/close | Recursive descent parser thrives |
| **Unambiguous lookahead** | `<slot>` vs `<slot-ref>` resolved in 1 token | No backtracking |
| **Hierarchical by nature** | Already tree-structured | AST = DOM-like tree |
| **Token streams are clean** | `"<", "IDENT", ">"` pattern | Simplifies lexer |
| **Easy extension** | Add `<match>` or `<try>` later | Backward compatible |

---

## üßÆ 6. Tokenizer Rules (LL(2) friendly)

| Token | Regex | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TAG\_OPEN | `<[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*` | `<slot` |
| TAG\_CLOSE | `</[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*>` | `</if>` |
| SELF\_CLOSE | `/>` | `<slot ... />` |
| ATTR\_NAME | `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*` | `name` |
| ATTR\_VALUE | `"[^"]*"` | `"project.files"` |
| TEXT | `[^<]+` | `Hello world` |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 7. Example Parse Tree (Visual)

### Tree:

This tree can be:

- Serialized to JSON
- Transformed programmatically
- Edited incrementally
- Traversed for logic evaluation

---

## üß† 8. Benefits & Trade-offs

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clean, recursive syntax | Can‚Äôt template HTML directly | Use a hybrid escape: `<raw-html>` |
| Perfect for LL parser | Slightly more verbose | Add shorthands like `<s i=1>` for `<slot index="1"/>` |
| DOM-like AST for editing | Requires XML-compliant lexer | Simplify with a permissive tag parser |
| Unlimited extensibility | Needs tag namespace management | Use `<sys:if>` vs `<usr:custom>` for clarity |

---

## üîå 9. Extension Model (Plugin Tags)

With tag-based syntax, plugins are simple to define:

Usage:

Output:

This allows your language to **grow naturally** into a declarative logic+templating language without ever breaking the base grammar.

---

## üß≠ 10. Implementation Roadmap

| Step | Task | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Tokenizer | Simple XML tokenizer with span tracking |
| 2 | LL(1)/LL(2) Parser | Recursive descent for nested tags |
| 3 | AST Builder | Convert tags to node types |
| 4 | Evaluator | Context + logic + plugin dispatch |
| 5 | Variable/Scope Engine | Manage `@var` and `<var>` |
| 6 | Renderer | Text output or AST-to-snippet expansion |
| 7 | Plugin Loader | Register and resolve custom tags |
| 8 | Tree Editing Tools | Replace nodes, rename vars, etc. |
| 9 | Persistence | Serialize AST to disk as snippet schema |

---

## üß† 11. Optional Hybrid Mode

If you still want *minimal backward compatibility*, you can support:

‚Ä¶which allows importing VSCode snippets by wrapping the `${}` syntax inside a tag while migrating users gradually.

---

## üß© 12. Summary

By moving to **HTML-tag‚Äìbased snippet syntax**, you gain:

- **Formal grammar stability**
- **True tree-based editing**
- **Infinite extensibility via tags**
- **Predictable LL(k) parsing**
- **Cleaner AST transformations**
- **Plugin-powered semantics**

You lose:

- The ability to template raw HTML directly (but can reintroduce it via `<raw>` or `<html-block>`)

---

Would you like me to now design the **LL(2) parser pseudocode + AST builder** for this HTML-tag‚Äìbased snippet language (with `<if>`, `<slot>`, `<for>`, `<func>`, etc.) ‚Äî ready to port into C#?  
That‚Äôs the next logical step in making this real.

---

so <switch "switchable"> <case 1 if="condition" content="content"/> <case 2 if="condition" content={contentValue}/> <switch /> <fn:tabstop#: functionName(param1, param2)/> <for x in y> <tag /> <for/> <choice:tabstop#:|1,2,3|> <alias: tabstop=1 alias="aliasName"/>// for semantic sugar as opposed to having to remember tabstop#s

---

Beautiful.  
That‚Äôs *exactly* the kind of advanced, **declarative-yet-executable snippet DSL** that leverages **structured LL(k) parsing** while remaining *human-friendly and readable*.

Your syntax proposal hits a *sweet spot* between **HTML/XML structure**, **functional logic**, and **data-driven snippet programming**. Let‚Äôs unpack your syntax, formalize it, and design how it would work under an LL(k) parser and AST-based runtime.

---

## üß© 1. Your Syntax Overview (Refined)

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre proposing ‚Äî restructured for readability:

### üîÄ Switch / Case Example

### ‚öôÔ∏è Function / Tabstop

### üîÅ For Loop

### üîò Choice

### üè∑Ô∏è Alias

---

## üß± 2. Syntax Philosophy

You‚Äôre defining a **hierarchical, structured DSL** for snippets that:

| Feature | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tag-based** | All logic is XML-style tags | `<for>`, `<switch>`, `<fn:...>` |
| **Declarative logic** | Flow control via attributes | `<if="condition">`, `<for x in y>` |
| **Functional snippets** | Functions as callable macros | `<fn:tabstop#>` |
| **Semantic aliasing** | Map human-readable aliases to tabstops | `<alias .../>` |
| **Composable** | Can nest logic or functions | `<switch>` inside `<for>`, etc. |
| **Extensible namespace model** | Use prefix for plugin features | `<fn:>`, `<sys:>`, `<user:>` |

---

## üå≤ 3. AST Node Model (C# Conceptual)

We can model this using **typed nodes** under a unified `TagNode` base.

And for general tags:

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. LL(k) Grammar (Formalized)

Here‚Äôs a clean **LL(2)** grammar draft for your new tag-based snippet DSL:

### üëá Breakdown

| Syntax | Meaning | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<switch value="x">` | start a switch block | expression in `value` |
| `<case match="1" if="cond"/>` | inline case | optional condition |
| `<fn:tabstop#: functionName(...) />` | function/tabstop call | namespaced functions |
| \` | 1,2,3 | \>\` |
| `<alias tabstop="1" name="aliasName"/>` | assign name to tabstop | resolves at runtime |
| `{contentValue}` | embedded expression | keeps language composable |

---

## üßÆ 5. Tokenization Plan

You‚Äôll want a token stream like this:

| Token | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<` | `<for` | tag open |
| `</` | `</for>` | close tag |
| `IDENT` | `for`, `switch`, `case`, `alias` | identifiers |
| `:` | `fn:` | namespace |
| `#` | `tabstop#` | tabstop id |
| `"`...`"` | `"value"` | string literal |
| `{`...`}` | `{expression}` | inline expression |
| \` | \` | \` |
| `>` | `>` | tag body open |
| `/>` | self-close |  |
| `TEXT` | raw content | literal text node |

This is **LL(1)** most of the time; **LL(2)** for constructs like `<case>` needing lookahead to see if it self-closes.

---

## üß† 6. Evaluation Semantics

At runtime:

| Construct | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `<switch>` | Evaluate `value`, find matching `<case>` (with optional `if`) |
| `<for>` | Iterate `in` expression, bind variable, evaluate body |
| `<fn:...>` | Call snippet function (user-defined or built-in) |
| `<choice:...>` | Present user with selectable options or pick one |
| `<alias>` | Register `tabstop ‚Üí aliasName` mapping |
| `<slot>` | Bind tabstop or alias to user input |
| `<var>` | Define scoped variables |
| `<if>` | Conditional inclusion |

---

## üß© 7. Namespaces and Extensibility

You‚Äôre effectively defining a **namespace model**:

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fn:` | function definition/invocation | `<fn:print("x")/>` |
| `sys:` | built-in tags (if, switch, etc.) | `<sys:if when="..."/>` |
| `usr:` | user-defined or plugin extensions | `<usr:upper text="..."/>` |
| *(none)* | base snippet domain | `<for>`, `<choice>`, `<slot>` |

‚úÖ **Benefit:** allows new features to be added without grammar rewrite ‚Äî only registry extension.

---

## ‚ö° 8. Pros, Cons, and Solutions

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully structural syntax | Verbosity vs `${}` shorthand | Provide optional shorthand parser |
| LL(k)-friendly grammar | XML parser needed for tags | Use custom tokenizer, not XML DOM |
| Infinite extensibility | Requires namespace resolution | Maintain registry for tag namespaces |
| Tree-editable snippets | Can't inline HTML easily | Add `<raw>` or `<html>` escape node |
| Declarative logic | Tag/attr combos can be verbose | Allow alias expansion or template macros |

---

## üß≠ 9. Example Parse Tree

Input:

AST:

---

## üß© 10. Integration with Tree Editing

Since the parser outputs a strongly-typed AST, your editor can:

- Rename tabstops (`tabstop#1 ‚Üí tabstop#header`)
- Refactor function names
- Move nodes between cases/loops
- Serialize/deserialize efficiently
- Preview resolved snippet expansion dynamically

For instance:

---

## üß† 11. Summary of Your Language So Far

| Category | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Logic** | `<if>`, `<switch>`, `<case>`, `<for>` | Conditional and iterative control |
| **Data Binding** | `<slot>`, `<alias>`, `<choice>` | User input and variable mapping |
| **Functions** | `<fn:...>` | Executable or macro-like snippets |
| **Variables** | `<var>`, `<var-ref>` | Scoped variable management |
| **Extensibility** | Namespaced tags (`fn:`, `sys:`, `usr:`) | Plugin-based expansion |
| **Editing** | AST-driven | Allows semantic code manipulation |

---

## üß© 12. Next Steps

You‚Äôre ready for one of two next concrete steps:

### Option A: LL(2) Recursive Descent Parser Pseudocode

A full breakdown of:

- Tokenizer rules
- Parser functions (for each construct)
- AST builder calls  
	‚úÖ *Good if you‚Äôre ready to start implementing in C#.*

### Option B: Runtime Evaluator + Scoping Model

Covers:

- Variable stack (global/local/function)
- Function resolution
- Loop/switch evaluation
- Alias registry  
	‚úÖ *Good if you want to plan the runtime logic next.*

---

Which one do you want me to do next ‚Äî  
**(A)** the LL(2) parser pseudocode + AST builder,  
or **(B)** the runtime evaluator and variable/scoping design?

---

---

Exactly ‚Äî and you‚Äôre thinking about this the **right way**.  
Designing your snippet language as **HTML-like but logic-aware** gives you **extreme structural flexibility**, while keeping it approachable and easily parsed by an LL(k) parser.  
Let‚Äôs go over how to set up the **architecture, syntax rules, parsing model, runtime evaluation**, and how to prepare the system for **modular extensions, user-defined variables/functions, and large-scale editing** later.

---

## üß± 1. Language Backbone Overview

You‚Äôre essentially building a **Snippet DSL** that:

- Uses **HTML-style tags** for structure and nesting.
- Embeds **logic constructs** (`<if>`, `<for>`, `<switch>`, `<fn:call>`).
- Uses **attribute-style parameters** for readability and extensibility.
- Is **language-agnostic** at the core (you can plug in JS or Python later).

Example syntax:

This lets you support:

- **Dynamic tabstops** (`<tabstop id="1"/>`)
- **Aliases** for readability (`<alias tabstop="1" alias="username"/>`)
- **Logic blocks** (`<if>`, `<switch>`, `<for>`)
- **Custom functions** (`<fn:define>`, `<fn:call>`)
- **Interpolated expressions** (`{expression}` inside text nodes)
- **Composable modules** (user-shared functions/snippets)

---

## üß© 2. LL(k) Parsing Requirements

You only need LL(2) or LL(3) for this.  
Reason: the structure is tag-based and predictable, so the only ambiguity is between:

- Self-closing tags (`<tag />`)
- Nested tags (`<tag>...</tag>`)

### Example Grammar (Simplified)

---

## üå≥ 3. AST Design (Core Nodes)

| Node Type | Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SnippetRoot` | `<snippet>` | Root document |
| `TextNode` | `Hello, world` | Literal text |
| `TagNode` | `<if condition="x">` | General tag container |
| `ExpressionNode` | `{x + 1}` | Inline expression |
| `FnDefineNode` | `<fn:define>` | Defines function |
| `FnCallNode` | `<fn:call>` | Executes function |
| `SwitchNode`, `CaseNode` | `<switch>`, `<case>` | Conditional branches |
| `ForNode` | `<for x in y>` | Loop over collection |
| `VarNode` | `<var name="x" />` | Variable lookup |
| `AliasNode` | `<alias tabstop="1" alias="name" />` | Tabstop alias |

This will allow nested evaluation and AST transformations later (e.g., mass-refactoring, renaming, optimization, etc.).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Runtime Evaluation Model

Once parsed, you‚Äôll need an **evaluator** that walks the AST and executes logic.

### Example Flow

**Evaluation flow:**

1. Look up `users` from the environment (JS context).
2. Iterate each `x`.
3. Evaluate `x.active`.
4. Render the branch if true.

### Execution Context

Maintain a scoped environment (like JS `scope`):

You can implement it using a JS engine like:

- **Jint** (for embedding JS in.NET)
- Or later: **isolated modular runtime**

---

## üß† 5. Modular Extension Model

You want **user-defined modules**, shareable via files or network.

### Structure

Each file defines snippets, functions, or aliases that register into the runtime.

### Example Module Declaration

Modules can be:

- **Loaded dynamically**
- **Scoped (local vs global)**
- **Composable** via `<use module="date-utils" />`

---

## üßÆ 6. Editing Tree for Large-Scale Transformations

Because your snippet is parsed into an AST:

- You can modify **specific nodes** (e.g., all `<case>` elements)
- You can **serialize back to source** (lossless round-trip)
- You can **merge**, **diff**, or **map** large snippet collections

### Example operations:

| Operation | Example | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rename variable | `x ‚Üí user` | Update all occurrences |
| Extract function | Convert inline logic to `<fn:define>` | Improve reuse |
| Inline expansion | Replace `<fn:call>` with body | Useful for flattening |
| Refactor | Move repeated structures to module | Maintainability |

---

## üß© 7. Why JS is a Smart Backbone Choice

| Feature | Benefit |
| --- | --- |
| Dynamic typing | Easier for end users |
| Simple syntax | Low barrier for user extensions |
| Expression support | Perfect for inline `{}` evaluation |
| JSON ecosystem | Natural fit for configuration, state |
| Portable | Can run in browser, desktop, or embedded |

**Implementation in.NET:**  
Use **Jint** (or ClearScript) to host a JS runtime:

- Safe sandboxing
- Load per-user environment
- Predefine context variables

---

## üßÆ 8. Example Unified Snippet

**AST Representation (simplified):**

---

## ‚ö° 9. Pros, Cons, and Mitigations

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structured, human-readable | No HTML templating | Use JSX or React instead |
| Easy LL(k) parsing | Slightly verbose syntax | Add shorthand variants (`<if? condition="x">`) |
| Modular and shareable | Requires runtime context | Lazy-load modules & sandboxes |
| Supports logic & loops | Complex validation | Add schema validation per tag |
| Safe (sandboxable) | Some duplication | Allow aliasing and macros |

---

## üß≠ 10. Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Finalize grammar** (tag syntax, attributes, self-closing rules)
2. üîß **Implement tokenizer** (span-based, position-aware)
3. üß† **Implement LL(2) recursive descent parser**
4. üå≥ **Build AST model**
5. üß© **Add evaluator with JS runtime**
6. üß± **Design modular registry (functions, variables, modules)**
7. üíæ **Add serialization/deserialization (AST ‚Üî source)**
8. üî• **Integrate with editor for live tree updates**

---

Would you like me to write the **grammar and pseudocode** for the LL(2) parser based on your HTML-like snippet syntax (with `<for>`, `<switch>`, `<fn:call>`, etc.) next?  
That would give you a full backbone to start implementing it in C# right away.

---

and i also want the llk parser to create a lsp so that the snippet systems can be appropriately documented, and i want to have a more dynamic than static documentation engine if you get what i mean

---

Yep ‚Äî that makes **perfect sense**.

You‚Äôre essentially describing a **self-documenting snippet language** that integrates into an **LSP (Language Server Protocol)** architecture ‚Äî where your **LL(k) parser** not only parses and validates snippets, but also **feeds metadata into a dynamic documentation and tooling system**.

This gives you IDE-like insight into snippets, variables, functions, and modules ‚Äî all while keeping documentation *live*, *contextual*, and *reflective of the user‚Äôs own customizations*.

Let‚Äôs break it down into a **clear architecture plan** that integrates all these components coherently.

---

## üß© 1. Core Goal Summary

You want:

1. **An LL(k) parser** that builds:
	- An **AST** (for evaluation and editing)
	- A **symbol table / semantic model** (for LSP + docs)
2. **An LSP backend** that:
	- Exposes completions, definitions, references, hover info, etc.
	- Is **driven dynamically** by the user‚Äôs modules, functions, and snippets
3. **A dynamic documentation system** that:
	- Is generated from the AST and symbol table
	- Automatically updates when snippets, modules, or functions change
	- Is queryable (e.g. through a docs panel, command palette, or web UI)
	- Supports **reflection and metadata introspection**

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Parser as the Source of Truth

The LL(k) parser becomes the **semantic compiler** for your language ‚Äî not only producing an AST but also building a **symbol table** that describes every defined element.

### Symbol Table Example

| Symbol Type | Name | Attributes | Source | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Function | greet | params: name | user.fn | global |
| Variable | user | type: object | context | runtime |
| Module | date-utils | version: 1.0 | modules/date-utils.snip | global |
| Snippet | greetUser | aliases, tabstops | greet.snip | global |
| Alias | username | tabstop: 1 | greet.snip | local |

This structure feeds both:

- **LSP capabilities** (auto-completion, hover info, goto definition)
- **Dynamic documentation generation**

---

## üìö 4. Dynamic Documentation Engine

Instead of static Markdown docs, your docs engine is **semantic + reflective**.  
It pulls from the **current parsed state** of snippets and modules.

### Conceptual Design

### Dynamic Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| üîÑ Auto-update | Docs regenerate on file/module change |
| üß≠ Introspective | Shows where symbols are defined/used |
| üìò Structured | Each snippet/function/module becomes a documented entity |
| üí° Live Examples | Evaluated output snippets embedded dynamically |
| üß© Extendable | Users can document custom functions via metadata attributes |

### Example: Auto-generated doc entry

---

## üß† 5. LSP Feature Integration

### 5.1 Completion Provider

- Auto-suggest available tags (`<if>`, `<for>`, `<fn:call>`, etc.)
- Auto-suggest known functions, variables, and aliases
- Context-aware completions (`<case when="...">` inside `<switch>`)

### 5.2 Hover Information

- Shows documentation snippet for hovered tag or function
- Pulls metadata from doc engine or inline doc comments

Example:

### 5.3 Go-To Definition

- Jump to the definition of a function, alias, or snippet in source

### 5.4 Diagnostics

- Reports syntax or semantic errors from parser
- LSP can show inline red squiggles with hints

Example diagnostic:

### 5.5 Signature Help

When typing `params=` inside `<fn:call>`, show parameter list dynamically.

---

## üß© 6. Dynamic Docs vs Static Docs

| Feature | Static Docs | Dynamic Docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update mechanism | Manual regeneration | Auto-updates from AST |
| Accuracy | Can desync | Always current |
| User-defined | Hardcoded | Reflects user‚Äôs runtime |
| Context-aware | No | Yes (based on open file/module) |
| Integration | External | Inline (via LSP + UI) |

**Verdict:**  
Dynamic docs are perfect for a snippet engine because your language is *user-extensible*, and static docs would constantly lag behind user modifications.

---

## üß± 7. Implementation Plan (C# + JS Runtime)

| Step | Component | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Tokenizer | Span-based lexer for HTML-like syntax |
| 2 | LL(2) Parser | Builds AST + SymbolTable |
| 3 | Semantic Analyzer | Extracts symbol metadata |
| 4 | LSP Server | Implements hover, completion, diagnostics |
| 5 | Doc Engine | Generates JSON/YAML/HTML docs dynamically |
| 6 | File Watcher | Triggers parser on change for hot reload |
| 7 | JS Runtime (Jint) | Evaluates expressions for examples/docs |

---

## üß© 8. Metadata Extensions for Docs

Allow doc metadata inline (like JSDoc):

Parser can treat these as **DocComment nodes** and feed them directly into the documentation generator and LSP.

---

## üßÆ 9. Pros, Cons, and Mitigations

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unified source of truth | Adds complexity to parser | Modularize semantic extraction |
| Live, accurate docs | Heavier computation | Cache incremental AST changes |
| Great IDE support | Requires JSON-RPC server | Use `OmniSharp` or `Langium` template |
| User-friendly | More setup overhead | Auto-configure via extension manifest |

---

## üß≠ 10. Future Evolutions

Once the LSP and dynamic docs are stable, you can add:

- **Interactive docs**: Execute snippets live in docs (like Jupyter cells)
- **Snip-graph visualizer**: Render dependency graph of functions/snippets
- **Doc search engine**: Fuzzy search all snippets/functions by tag or name
- **Versioned docs**: Keep per-module documentation history

---

Would you like me to outline the **data model and interfaces** for the documentation + LSP integration next?  
(i.e., how to structure `SymbolInfo`, `DocEntry`, `LspProvider`, and `ParserContext` in code terms ‚Äî enough to implement it cleanly in C#.)

---

nah documentation will just be md but with dynamic capabilities to fit contexts etc based off of this convo give me a more organized compilation of my proposed idea

---

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs compile everything we‚Äôve discussed into a **clean, organized, and technically detailed design summary** of your proposed **HTML-like Snippet Language & Engine with LL(k) Parser, LSP Integration, and Dynamic Markdown Documentation**.

This version keeps everything **coherent, hierarchical, and implementation-oriented**, showing exactly what you‚Äôre building, why it‚Äôs unique, and how it all fits together.

---

## üß† Project Proposal: Advanced Snippet Engine with LL(k) Parser and Dynamic Docs

---

## 1\. üß© Core Concept

You are designing a **next-generation snippet system** inspired by **VSCode snippets**, but:

- **More expressive** ‚Äî supports logic, functions, loops, and user-defined variables.
- **More structured** ‚Äî uses **HTML-like tags** instead of `${}` placeholders.
- **More modular** ‚Äî allows user-defined modules and reusable components.
- **More introspective** ‚Äî supports **LL(k)** parsing, **AST-based editing**, and **LSP** integration.
- **More documented** ‚Äî generates **dynamic Markdown documentation** from parsed definitions.

This makes it not just a snippet manager ‚Äî but a **miniature logic-aware templating language** suitable for code authoring, auto-documentation, and IDE augmentation.

---

## 2\. ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture Overview

---

## 3\. üß± Snippet Language Overview

### üí° Syntax Philosophy

- **HTML-like tags** ‚Üí simple, nestable, readable.
- **Attribute-driven logic** ‚Üí cleaner and explicit control flow.
- **Self-closing tags** for single-use constructs.
- **Namespaced functions** using `fn:` prefix.

### ‚ú® Example Snippet

---

## 4\. üìú Supported Constructs

| Construct | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<var>` | `<var name="username" />` | Inserts variable value |
| `<alias>` | `<alias tabstop="1" alias="userName"/>` | Semantic name for tabstop |
| `<tabstop>` | `<tabstop id="1" />` | Insertion point for editor |
| `<choice>` | `<choice id="2" values="yes,no,maybe"/>` | Offers selectable options |
| `<fn:define>` | `<fn:define name="greet">...</fn:define>` | Define reusable function |
| `<fn:call>` | `<fn:call name="greet" params="Cal"/>` | Invoke function |
| `<for>` | `<for x in items>...</for>` | Iterate over collection |
| `<switch>` | `<switch value="x">...</switch>` | Multi-branch logic |
| `<case>` | `<case when="1">...</case>` | Condition in switch |
| `<if>` | `<if condition="x > 1">...</if>` | Conditional rendering |

---

## 5\. üß© Grammar Overview (LL(2))

Simplified EBNF outline for the parser:

- **LL(2)** is sufficient to resolve ambiguities between self-closing and nested tags.
- Expressions within `{}` are evaluated at runtime (via JS).

---

## 6\. üå≥ AST & Symbol Table Model

### AST Nodes

| Node Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SnippetRoot` | Root snippet structure |
| `TagNode` | Generic tag node with name, attributes, and children |
| `TextNode` | Plain text or interpolated text |
| `ExpressionNode` | Inline `{expression}` blocks |
| `FnDefineNode` | Defines reusable snippet functions |
| `FnCallNode` | Executes a defined function |
| `VarNode` | Variable access |
| `AliasNode` | Alias tabstop/variable mapping |
| `ForNode` | Iterative loop |
| `SwitchNode` / `CaseNode` | Branch logic |

### Symbol Table

Holds all declared entities for introspection, LSP, and documentation.

| Symbol | Kind | Scope | Metadata |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| greet | Function | Global | Params: name |
| user | Variable | Global | Type: object |
| tabstop:1 | Tabstop | Local | Aliases: username |
| greetUser | Snippet | Global | Description: "User greeting" |

---

## 7\. ‚öôÔ∏è Runtime and Evaluation

### JS Runtime Integration

Use **Jint** (C#-embedded JS engine) to evaluate:

- Inline expressions (`{x + 1}`)
- Conditional logic
- Function bodies
- Loops and runtime computations

### Scoped Context Example

Evaluation occurs recursively over AST nodes, producing text output or editor transformations.

---

## 8\. üß© Modular System

Snippets and functions can be grouped into **modules**:

Each module:

- Declares its functions/snippets
- Can depend on others via `<use module="name"/>`
- Can be **shared, loaded dynamically**, or **hot-reloaded**

---

## 9\. üß† LSP Integration

The parser powers an **LSP server** to enhance editor experience.

### Supported Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Completions | Suggest tags, functions, variables |
| Hover Info | Display doc metadata from dynamic Markdown |
| Go-to Definition | Jump to function/snippet declaration |
| Diagnostics | Syntax and semantic error reporting |
| Signature Help | Show function params inline |
| Rename | AST-safe symbol renaming |
| Refactor | Structural snippet refactoring |

---

## 10\. üìö Documentation System (Dynamic Markdown)

Instead of static docs, documentation is **Markdown-based but dynamic**, generated and updated from the parser + symbol table.

### Example Generated Markdown

**Result:**

```markdown
pgsql
### Dynamic Capabilities
- Auto-updates when functions or snippets change.
- Context-aware (resolves local imports, variables).
- Supports embedded live examples or evaluations.
- Cross-linked (clickable references to functions/modules).

---

Would you like me to follow up with a **specification document structure** (like an RFC / formal language definition document) next ‚Äî outlining how the tag grammar, evaluation model, and metadata schema will be written for developer reference?
```

---

i will also make a custom ide for the engine providing qol features as well as compression and expansion of snippets like regions and all that shit the templating language will also work for snippetting any language, it will be language agnostic not language specific ill also take advantage of the tree structure of parent and child nodes for large scale edits and structural changes which will hopefully shorten dev time and lessen human error ill have to figure out any caveats of using an llk parser over a packrat before development when it comes to syntax development of the language which will essentially be a slightly different form of html/xml tag; will use packrat if its better but not sure that ill need the state handling, but probably wouldnt hurt, just more annoying in development and all that shit i have ideas for forloops, functions, user defined vars, etc, etc, but what else would be helpful either as qol or neglected necessities of snippet engine systems??

---

Excellent ‚Äî you‚Äôre building a **fully-fledged snippet language + IDE + templating platform** that‚Äôs structured, language-agnostic, and capable of programmatic manipulation through its tree model.

You already cover the *core pillars* (parser, AST, runtime, LSP, modularity, docs, and IDE integration).  
So let‚Äôs build on that with **QOL (quality of life)** and **neglected essentials** that most snippet engines overlook ‚Äî features that will make your system more powerful, practical, and pleasant to use.

## üß© 8. Neglected But Critical Essentials in Snippet Systems

| Neglected Feature | Why It Matters | Implementation Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cross-language Targeting** | Allows one snippet to adapt to JS, Python, C#, etc. | Define `<target>` or template transformers |

## ‚öñÔ∏è 11. LL(k) vs Packrat Parser ‚Äî Key Comparison

| Feature | LL(k) | Packrat (PEG) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Predictive Parsing** | Yes (deterministic) | No (backtracking) |
| **Performance** | O(n) if unambiguous | O(n) but higher constant factor |
| **Ease of Grammar Debugging** | Easier to reason about | Can mask ambiguity errors |
| **Error Recovery** | Easier | Harder (due to backtracking) |
| **Context Sensitivity** | Limited | Flexible |
| **Best For** | Structured, predictable grammars (HTML-like) | Dynamic or ambiguous grammars |

‚úÖ **Recommendation:**  
Use **LL(k)** for initial development (simpler, faster, easier debugging).  
If you later introduce advanced syntactic sugar (like optional shorthand, expression interpolation, or context-aware parsing), you can switch to **Packrat (PEG)** or **hybrid LL(k)/PEG** with memoization.

---

Would you like me to follow up by designing a **feature roadmap** for the IDE itself (structured by UX layers, editor components, AST inspectors, and dynamic documentation integration)?  
That would complete your architecture‚Äôs **frontend + backend coherence**.

---

yeah their will also be imports and exports of snippet components; the snippets themselves will be saved/edited/created as snippet modules and imported to/from the project/module level, not the file level computed attributes as well, and yes their will be inline expressions as well as definable codeblock tag, this will just use js, everywhere that there is code in the actual snippet itself will be js only, i cant/wont add all language capabilities event hooks will be good too, but id really rather keep things logic based as opposed to event based, so will probably stick with ifs and switches and other logic tags(all logic tags will be able to be children of both logical and non logical parents if ya get what i mean) yes assertions are a good idea

---

Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôre locking in a **consistent, logic-first snippet meta-language** with modular extensibility and strong runtime cohesion.  
You‚Äôre avoiding the ‚ÄúDSL sprawl‚Äù problem by **anchoring execution and evaluation exclusively in JS**, while maintaining a declarative logic-layer (tags like `<if>`, `<switch>`, `<for>`, `<assert>`).  
That‚Äôs an extremely smart design ‚Äî it keeps **expressive power high** while **syntactic complexity low**.

Let‚Äôs compile and structure everything we‚Äôve discussed so far into a **coherent and complete design blueprint**, with clear architecture layers, design principles, feature sets, and implementation notes.

---

## üß© Snippet Engine ‚Äî Structured Design Blueprint

---

## üß± 1. Core Concept

A **language-agnostic snippet engine** built on an **LL(k) (or hybrid Packrat) parser**, using **HTML/XML-like tags** to define logical, structural, and variable components of snippets.

Snippets are defined within **modules**, not files.  
Modules can **import/export snippet components**, **define user variables**, **register functions**, and **compose logic trees**.

---

## üß© 2. Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Language Agnostic** | Can template or generate snippets for *any* target language (C#, JS, HTML, etc.). |
| **Logic-Driven** | Controlled by `<if>`, `<switch>`, `<for>`, `<assert>` instead of reactive events. |
| **JS-only Computation** | Any executable expression, function, or code block is JavaScript. |
| **Tree-Based** | Every snippet is represented as a hierarchical tree of nodes (for logic and editing). |
| **Composable** | Snippets are modular, sharable, and composable via imports/exports. |
| **Declarative + Extensible** | Tag-based declarative syntax for logic and flow; extensible via registry. |
| **Dynamic Documentation** | Documentation generated automatically as Markdown, but context-aware. |
| **IDE-integrated** | Custom IDE provides editing, compression/expansion, and dynamic preview. |

## üß≠ 4. Structural Hierarchy

**Note:**  
Snippets are loaded, parsed, and compiled at the **module level**, not file level.  
This allows:

- Cross-project sharing
- Versioned snippet modules
- Scoped variable/function definitions

---

## üß© 5. Parser & AST Design

### Parsing Strategy:

- **LL(k)** (or hybrid LL(k)/Packrat) for deterministic and recursive structures.
- Grammar mirrors HTML/XML but supports embedded JS `{ ... }` expressions.

### AST Nodes:

| Node Type | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TagNode` | `<for each="x in y">` | Represents structural control flow |
| `ExprNode` | `{x + y}` | Represents inline JS expression |
| `VarNode` | `<var name="n" default="1"/>` | Variable declaration |
| `FnDefineNode` | `<fn:define name="foo">...</fn:define>` | Function definition |
| `ImportNode` | `<import from="core" />` | Module import |
| `MetaNode` | `<meta author="Cal"/>` | Metadata tag |
| `CodeBlockNode` | `<codeblock>...</codeblock>` | Embedded JS |
| `SnippetNode` | `<snippet name="...">...</snippet>` | Root of a snippet definition |

## ‚öñÔ∏è 11. LL(k) vs Packrat ‚Äî Final Decision Points

| Criteria | LL(k) | Packrat (PEG) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Syntax Clarity** | ‚úÖ Simple | ‚ö†Ô∏è Can hide ambiguity |
| **Performance** | ‚úÖ O(n) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly heavier O(n) |
