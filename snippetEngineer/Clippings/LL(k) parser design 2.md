i have a project idea to make an llk parser for a snippet engine

---

Excellent idea ‚Äî an **LL(k) parser for a snippet engine** is a powerful and flexible foundation that can support nested, templated, and logic-based snippet definitions while remaining fast and predictable.

Let‚Äôs walk through a **structured plan** for designing and implementing it, with all the key fundamentals, architectural considerations, and extensibility points.

---

## üß© 1. Core Concept

An **LL(k) parser** (Left-to-right, Leftmost derivation, k-token lookahead) is ideal for:

- **Predictable** parsing (deterministic and efficient)
- **Readable** grammars (matches snippet DSLs that look like HTML or structured text)
- **Real-time** parsing (excellent for editors or live AST reloading)
- **Extensible** constructs (e.g., conditionals, mirrors, tabstops)

Your snippet engine will parse a **snippet DSL**, something like:

‚Ä¶and transform it into an AST for runtime expansion, editing, and mirroring.

---

## üß± 2. Core Architecture Overview

### Diagram

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Pipeline Components

### 3.1 Tokenizer (Lexer)

- Splits input into atomic units.
- Keeps **source position info** for traceability.
- Should be **context-aware** (e.g. inside `${...}` or `<if>`).

**Example tokens:**

| Token Type | Example Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TAG\_OPEN | `<snippet` | Start of a tag |
| TAG\_CLOSE | `>` | End of a tag |
| IDENT | `snippet` | Identifier |
| TEXT | `hello world` | Raw snippet text |
| PLACEHOLDER | `${1:name}` | Tabstop placeholder |
| LOGIC\_OPEN | `<if condition="...">` | Control structure |
| LOGIC\_CLOSE | `</if>` | Control end |

You can use **Superpower** or a custom span-based lexer for.NET.

---

### 3.2 LL(k) Parser

- Consumes tokens using a **predictive parsing table** or recursive descent.
- Handles **lookahead (k)** for resolving ambiguity (e.g., `<if>` vs `<identifier>`).
- Produces **typed nodes** in the AST.

**Example Grammar (simplified):**

---

### 3.3 AST Model

Each AST node should be typed, serializable, and human-readable.

**Example:**

---

### 3.4 Evaluator & Renderer

- Walks the AST and substitutes placeholders, mirrors, and conditions.
- Optionally re-hydrates snippets from AST ‚Üí text for editor syncing.

**Logic handling options:**

- Hardcoded condition evaluation (`if`, `else`, etc.)
- Plug-in evaluator (e.g. using expression parser)
- Context-aware (e.g. snippet variables, system context)

---

## üß† 4. LL(k) Parsing Strategy

**Key choice:**  
You can implement LL(k) manually or generate it.

| Approach | Description | Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Recursive Descent | Handwritten parser | Easy to debug, flexible | Verbose | Build generator helpers |
| Parser Table | Precomputed table from grammar | Fast | Harder to maintain manually | Build generator or tooling |
| Hybrid (LL(2) typical) | Minimal lookahead manually handled | Simple for DSLs | Limited k-depth | Use 2-token lookahead only |

For a snippet engine, **Recursive Descent LL(2)** is perfect.

---

## üß© 5. Error Handling & Recovery

Use **panic mode** or **synchronization tokens** (`</snippet>`, `</if>`, etc.)  
Provide **precise errors with source spans**.

**Example:**

---

## üîå 6. Extensibility Design

Your parser should support **plugin-defined nodes**.

### Example plugin model:

Then discovered dynamically with reflection at startup.

---

## üßÆ 7. Performance Tips

| Technique | Benefit |
| --- | --- |
| Span-based lexing (`ReadOnlySpan<char>`) | No string allocations |
| Reuse token objects | Reduced GC pressure |
| Use struct-based `Token` | Cache locality |
| Short-circuit parsing when confident | Speed |
| Pre-tokenize for multiple passes | Efficiency |

---

## ‚ö° 8. Pros, Cons, and Solutions

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Deterministic and fast parsing | Harder to handle ambiguity | Restrict grammar and use lookahead |
| Easy to debug | Manual code growth | Generate parser helpers |
| Great for IDE use | Poor for left recursion | Rewrite grammar to be right-recursive |

---

## üîß 9. Development Plan (Step-by-Step)

| Step | Task | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Define grammar (EBNF or BNF) | Keep small and clean |
| 2 | Implement tokenizer | Include position tracking |
| 3 | Implement LL(2) parser | Recursive descent preferred |
| 4 | Create AST node types | Typed record structures |
| 5 | Implement evaluator | With plugin support |
| 6 | Add error recovery | Source-based reporting |
| 7 | Add test suite | For all snippet patterns |
| 8 | Integrate editor runtime | e.g., Scintilla, Monaco, etc. |

---

## üß≠ 10. Future Expansions

- **Logic integration:** Embed expression evaluation (`<if condition="user.loggedIn">`)
- **Macro expansion:** Inline reusable snippets
- **Context binding:** Resolve variables from runtime (e.g. project name)
- **Graph visualization:** AST or dependency visualization for debugging
- **Hot reload:** Re-parse snippets on file change

---

Would you like me to write the **LL(2) recursive descent pseudocode** for this snippet engine grammar next (including placeholders and `<if>` tags)?  
That would give you a ready base to start implementing it in C#.

---

i want to make the snippet language like vscodes but more extendable so there can be functions as well as for loops, switch statements, etc, in the snippets instead of just basic choices and variables, i also want users to be able to define variables instead of just relying on the supplied variables; the llk parser is essentially just for handling nested variables in variables recursively, but there are other pros to take advantage of also; and i want to use the tree structure for larger scale edits also, etc

---

Perfect ‚Äî that‚Äôs a **powerful and scalable vision** for a snippet system: essentially a *‚Äúprogrammable snippet language‚Äù* that blends **VSCode-style snippet syntax** with **scripting and logic features**.  
You‚Äôre absolutely right: an **LL(k) parser** is *exactly* what you want for that ‚Äî predictable, human-readable, and recursive enough to handle variable nesting, tree transforms, and extendable language constructs.

Let‚Äôs design the system around your intent.

---

## üß© 1. Vision Overview

You‚Äôre not just building a snippet system ‚Äî you‚Äôre building a **Snippet DSL** with logic, structure, and composability.

### üß† Goal Summary

| Capability | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Extend VSCode Syntax** | Support `${1:name}` and `${VAR:default}` | `${userName:Guest}` |
| **User-Defined Variables** | Declare inside snippet or imported scope | `@var projectName = "AIEngine"` |
| **Functions / Logic Blocks** | Allow `<if>`, `<for>`, `<switch>` etc. | `<if user.isAdmin>Welcome ${user.name}</if>` |
| **Nested Variable Expansion** | Recursive substitutions | `${greeting${lang}}` |
| **Tree-Based Editing** | AST reflects editor content for large-scale refactors | Rename variable ‚Üí updates all mirrors |
| **Plugin Nodes** | Add custom constructs like `<fetch>`, `<date>`, `<query>` | `<date format="yyyy-MM-dd"/>` |

---

## üß± 2. Architectural Blueprint

Your parser is the **foundation** of an entire **snippet engine ecosystem**:

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Language Features (Core + Extensions)

### 3.1 Variable Declaration

### 3.2 Inline Variable Interpolation

### 3.3 Logic Blocks

### 3.4 Iteration

### 3.5 Switch / Case

### 3.6 Functions

---

## üå≤ 4. Why LL(k) Fits Perfectly

An **LL(k) parser** allows you to:

| Advantage | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Predictive parsing** | You can know how to parse `<if>` vs `<identifier>` from next token | `<if ...>` |
| **Nested constructs** | Handle `${${nested}}` cleanly with recursion | `${outer${inner}}` |
| **Lookahead (k>1)** | Differentiate between `<case>` and `<default>` | `<case "value">` |
| **Readable grammar** | Easier to extend and debug for new features | Add `<match>` or `<import>` later |
| **Tree-based refactor support** | Direct link between AST nodes and editor spans | Enables programmatic edits |

---

## üßÆ 5. Grammar Design (LL(2) Candidate)

Below is a *starting grammar* (simplified LL(2) pseudocode/BNF):

```markdown
mathematicaProgram           ‚Üí Statement*
Statement         ‚Üí VarDecl | FuncDecl | SnippetElement

VarDecl           ‚Üí "@var" IDENT "=" Expression
FuncDecl          ‚Üí "@func" IDENT "(" ArgList? ")" Block "@endfunc"
SnippetElement    ‚Üí Text | Placeholder | IfBlock | ForBlock | SwitchBlock | Call | Tag

Placeholder       ‚Üí "${" IDENT (":" Expression)? "}"
IfBlock           ‚Üí "<if" Expression ">" Program (ElseBlock)? "</if>"
ElseBlock         ‚Üí "<else>" Program
ForBlock          ‚Üí "<for" IDENT "in" Expression ">" Program "</for>"
SwitchBlock       ‚Üí "<switch" Expression ">" CaseBlock* DefaultBlock? "</switch>"
CaseBlock         ‚Üí "<case" Literal ">" Program
DefaultBlock      ‚Üí "<default>" Program
Call              ‚Üí "${" IDENT "(" ArgList? ")" "}"
Expression        ‚Üí Literal | IDENT | FunctionCall | NestedVar
NestedVar         ‚Üí "${" IDENT (":" Expression)? "}"
Literal           ‚Üí STRING | NUMBER | BOOLEAN
ArgList           ‚Üí Expression ("," Expression)*
Block             ‚Üí Program
```

‚úÖ This grammar:

- Supports **recursive variable expansion**
- Handles **logic and iteration**
- Allows **function definitions and invocations**
- Fits **LL(2)** easily (limited ambiguity)

---

## üß† 6. AST Tree Design

Your **AST** should model all major constructs cleanly.

---

## üß∞ 7. Variable & Scope Management

Use a **hierarchical variable registry**:

When evaluating, scopes stack:

---

## üîå 8. Plugin & Extensibility Model

Plugins can register new tags or expressions dynamically.

Registered via reflection:

---

## üß† 9. Tree-Based Editing & Transformation

Once you have the AST, you can:

- Traverse and **edit variable names** programmatically.
- Apply **bulk text transformations** without regex.
- Build **semantic search** (e.g., find all `${projectName}` mirrors).
- Re-serialize back to text after edits.

For instance:

---

## ‚ö° 10. Implementation Phases (Recommended Order)

| Phase | Component | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Tokenizer** | Lexical rules for tags, placeholders, variables |
| 2 | **LL(2) Parser** | Grammar-based recursive descent |
| 3 | **AST Builder** | Tree construction |
| 4 | **Evaluator** | Variable/logic resolution |
| 5 | **Runtime Context** | Variable scopes, plugin registry |
| 6 | **Renderer** | To text, or to structured editor view |
| 7 | **Tree Transformer API** | Edits, mirroring, refactors |
| 8 | **Plugin Loader** | External extensions |
| 9 | **Testing & Validation** | Grammar edge cases, nested recursion |

---

## üßÆ 11. Pros, Cons, and Solutions

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extendable, readable DSL | Potential for grammar conflicts | Use LL(2) and restrict ambiguous forms |
| Ideal for live editors | Parser may grow complex | Build modular grammar components |
| Tree-based editing | AST sync requires effort | Add Span tracking to all nodes |
| Plugin power | Versioning of plugins | Use semantic versioning in registry |

---

## üß≠ 12. Summary

You‚Äôre building an **LL(k)-based programmable snippet language**, that will:

- Parse recursively nested variables
- Allow embedded logic and flow control
- Support dynamic variable definitions and scoping
- Build a manipulable AST for editing and transformations
- Be extensible through plugin nodes and runtime functions

---

Would you like me to next:

1. Write **the full LL(2) recursive descent pseudocode** for the grammar above (with tokenizer rules included), or
2. Design **the runtime evaluator and variable scoping model** that runs the parsed AST?

Either is a perfect next step.

---

instead of the ${#:x} format, i want it to be html tag based, that will mean that we cant template html, but we already have reacrt, vue, etc, so it doesnt mean much

---

That‚Äôs actually a **very elegant and forward-thinking choice.**  
Switching from `${}` -based placeholders to **HTML-tag‚Äìbased snippet syntax** makes the language **cleaner**, **more composable**, and **far easier to extend** ‚Äî especially when your snippets are meant to represent structured, logic-aware templates, not raw text insertions.

You're effectively evolving from:

to something more like:

Let‚Äôs go over this design in depth, because it gives you **a huge number of structural and architectural advantages** ‚Äî particularly when building an **LL(k) parser** and **tree-based editor**.

---

## üß© 1. Core Design Shift

### üß† Old (VSCode-like)

### üß± New (Tag-based)

**Key differences:**

| Feature | VSCode-style | Tag-based |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Syntax | `${}` inline text | XML-like markup |
| Grammar complexity | Contextual (string parsing needed) | Well-formed LL(k)-parsable |
| Nesting | Hard (regex hell) | Easy (recursive node tree) |
| Extendability | Limited to `${choice}` and `${var}` | Unlimited (`<if>`, `<for>`, `<func>`, `<macro>`, etc.) |
| Parser type | Token-based string substitution | Structural grammar with predictable nodes |
| Editing | Difficult (regex + string replace) | Tree-based, semantic-aware edits |

---

## üß± 2. Example DSL Evolution

Let‚Äôs define some **canonical examples** using this HTML-tag model.

---

### ‚úÖ Basic placeholders

### ‚úÖ Choices

### ‚úÖ Mirrors

### ‚úÖ Variables

### ‚úÖ Logic

### ‚úÖ Loops

### ‚úÖ Functions

---

## üß† 3. LL(k) Grammar (Tag-based Form)

The LL(k) grammar becomes extremely clean, fully compatible with recursive descent parsing:

Then, the **TagName** can be specialized into snippet constructs:

This grammar is **LL(1)** in most cases and **LL(2)** only for `if/else` and similar constructs.

---

## üå≤ 4. AST Design (Simplified)

The AST mirrors the XML structure and becomes perfect for tree-based manipulation.

Then later, you can *specialize* tags:

---

## üß© 5. Why This Is Superior for LL(k)

| LL(k) Benefit | Description | Why It Matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Predictable nesting** | Each `<tag>` has a clear open/close | Recursive descent parser thrives |
| **Unambiguous lookahead** | `<slot>` vs `<slot-ref>` resolved in 1 token | No backtracking |
| **Hierarchical by nature** | Already tree-structured | AST = DOM-like tree |
| **Token streams are clean** | `"<", "IDENT", ">"` pattern | Simplifies lexer |
| **Easy extension** | Add `<match>` or `<try>` later | Backward compatible |

---

## üßÆ 6. Tokenizer Rules (LL(2) friendly)

| Token | Regex | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TAG\_OPEN | `<[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*` | `<slot` |
| TAG\_CLOSE | `</[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*>` | `</if>` |
| SELF\_CLOSE | `/>` | `<slot ... />` |
| ATTR\_NAME | `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*` | `name` |
| ATTR\_VALUE | `"[^"]*"` | `"project.files"` |
| TEXT | `[^<]+` | `Hello world` |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 7. Example Parse Tree (Visual)

### Tree:

This tree can be:

- Serialized to JSON
- Transformed programmatically
- Edited incrementally
- Traversed for logic evaluation

---

## üß† 8. Benefits & Trade-offs

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clean, recursive syntax | Can‚Äôt template HTML directly | Use a hybrid escape: `<raw-html>` |
| Perfect for LL parser | Slightly more verbose | Add shorthands like `<s i=1>` for `<slot index="1"/>` |
| DOM-like AST for editing | Requires XML-compliant lexer | Simplify with a permissive tag parser |
| Unlimited extensibility | Needs tag namespace management | Use `<sys:if>` vs `<usr:custom>` for clarity |

---

## üîå 9. Extension Model (Plugin Tags)

With tag-based syntax, plugins are simple to define:

Usage:

Output:

This allows your language to **grow naturally** into a declarative logic+templating language without ever breaking the base grammar.

---

## üß≠ 10. Implementation Roadmap

| Step | Task | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Tokenizer | Simple XML tokenizer with span tracking |
| 2 | LL(1)/LL(2) Parser | Recursive descent for nested tags |
| 3 | AST Builder | Convert tags to node types |
| 4 | Evaluator | Context + logic + plugin dispatch |
| 5 | Variable/Scope Engine | Manage `@var` and `<var>` |
| 6 | Renderer | Text output or AST-to-snippet expansion |
| 7 | Plugin Loader | Register and resolve custom tags |
| 8 | Tree Editing Tools | Replace nodes, rename vars, etc. |
| 9 | Persistence | Serialize AST to disk as snippet schema |

---

## üß† 11. Optional Hybrid Mode

If you still want *minimal backward compatibility*, you can support:

‚Ä¶which allows importing VSCode snippets by wrapping the `${}` syntax inside a tag while migrating users gradually.

---

## üß© 12. Summary

By moving to **HTML-tag‚Äìbased snippet syntax**, you gain:

- **Formal grammar stability**
- **True tree-based editing**
- **Infinite extensibility via tags**
- **Predictable LL(k) parsing**
- **Cleaner AST transformations**
- **Plugin-powered semantics**

You lose:

- The ability to template raw HTML directly (but can reintroduce it via `<raw>` or `<html-block>`)

---

Would you like me to now design the **LL(2) parser pseudocode + AST builder** for this HTML-tag‚Äìbased snippet language (with `<if>`, `<slot>`, `<for>`, `<func>`, etc.) ‚Äî ready to port into C#?  
That‚Äôs the next logical step in making this real.

---

so <switch "switchable"> <case 1 if="condition" content="content"/> <case 2 if="condition" content={contentValue}/> <switch /> <fn:tabstop#: functionName(param1, param2)/> <for x in y> <tag /> <for/> <choice:tabstop#:|1,2,3|> <alias: tabstop=1 alias="aliasName"/>// for semantic sugar as opposed to having to remember tabstop#s

---

Beautiful.  
That‚Äôs *exactly* the kind of advanced, **declarative-yet-executable snippet DSL** that leverages **structured LL(k) parsing** while remaining *human-friendly and readable*.

Your syntax proposal hits a *sweet spot* between **HTML/XML structure**, **functional logic**, and **data-driven snippet programming**. Let‚Äôs unpack your syntax, formalize it, and design how it would work under an LL(k) parser and AST-based runtime.

---

## üß© 1. Your Syntax Overview (Refined)

Here‚Äôs what you‚Äôre proposing ‚Äî restructured for readability:

### üîÄ Switch / Case Example

### ‚öôÔ∏è Function / Tabstop

### üîÅ For Loop

### üîò Choice

### üè∑Ô∏è Alias

---

## üß± 2. Syntax Philosophy

You‚Äôre defining a **hierarchical, structured DSL** for snippets that:

| Feature | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tag-based** | All logic is XML-style tags | `<for>`, `<switch>`, `<fn:...>` |
| **Declarative logic** | Flow control via attributes | `<if="condition">`, `<for x in y>` |
| **Functional snippets** | Functions as callable macros | `<fn:tabstop#>` |
| **Semantic aliasing** | Map human-readable aliases to tabstops | `<alias .../>` |
| **Composable** | Can nest logic or functions | `<switch>` inside `<for>`, etc. |
| **Extensible namespace model** | Use prefix for plugin features | `<fn:>`, `<sys:>`, `<user:>` |

---

## üå≤ 3. AST Node Model (C# Conceptual)

We can model this using **typed nodes** under a unified `TagNode` base.

And for general tags:

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. LL(k) Grammar (Formalized)

Here‚Äôs a clean **LL(2)** grammar draft for your new tag-based snippet DSL:

### üëá Breakdown

| Syntax | Meaning | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<switch value="x">` | start a switch block | expression in `value` |
| `<case match="1" if="cond"/>` | inline case | optional condition |
| `<fn:tabstop#: functionName(...) />` | function/tabstop call | namespaced functions |
| \` | 1,2,3 | \>\` |
| `<alias tabstop="1" name="aliasName"/>` | assign name to tabstop | resolves at runtime |
| `{contentValue}` | embedded expression | keeps language composable |

---

## üßÆ 5. Tokenization Plan

You‚Äôll want a token stream like this:

| Token | Example | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<` | `<for` | tag open |
| `</` | `</for>` | close tag |
| `IDENT` | `for`, `switch`, `case`, `alias` | identifiers |
| `:` | `fn:` | namespace |
| `#` | `tabstop#` | tabstop id |
| `"`...`"` | `"value"` | string literal |
| `{`...`}` | `{expression}` | inline expression |
| \` | \` | \` |
| `>` | `>` | tag body open |
| `/>` | self-close |  |
| `TEXT` | raw content | literal text node |

This is **LL(1)** most of the time; **LL(2)** for constructs like `<case>` needing lookahead to see if it self-closes.

---

## üß† 6. Evaluation Semantics

At runtime:

| Construct | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `<switch>` | Evaluate `value`, find matching `<case>` (with optional `if`) |
| `<for>` | Iterate `in` expression, bind variable, evaluate body |
| `<fn:...>` | Call snippet function (user-defined or built-in) |
| `<choice:...>` | Present user with selectable options or pick one |
| `<alias>` | Register `tabstop ‚Üí aliasName` mapping |
| `<slot>` | Bind tabstop or alias to user input |
| `<var>` | Define scoped variables |
| `<if>` | Conditional inclusion |

---

## üß© 7. Namespaces and Extensibility

You‚Äôre effectively defining a **namespace model**:

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fn:` | function definition/invocation | `<fn:print("x")/>` |
| `sys:` | built-in tags (if, switch, etc.) | `<sys:if when="..."/>` |
| `usr:` | user-defined or plugin extensions | `<usr:upper text="..."/>` |
| *(none)* | base snippet domain | `<for>`, `<choice>`, `<slot>` |

‚úÖ **Benefit:** allows new features to be added without grammar rewrite ‚Äî only registry extension.

---

## ‚ö° 8. Pros, Cons, and Solutions

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully structural syntax | Verbosity vs `${}` shorthand | Provide optional shorthand parser |
| LL(k)-friendly grammar | XML parser needed for tags | Use custom tokenizer, not XML DOM |
| Infinite extensibility | Requires namespace resolution | Maintain registry for tag namespaces |
| Tree-editable snippets | Can't inline HTML easily | Add `<raw>` or `<html>` escape node |
| Declarative logic | Tag/attr combos can be verbose | Allow alias expansion or template macros |

---

## üß≠ 9. Example Parse Tree

Input:

AST:

---

## üß© 10. Integration with Tree Editing

Since the parser outputs a strongly-typed AST, your editor can:

- Rename tabstops (`tabstop#1 ‚Üí tabstop#header`)
- Refactor function names
- Move nodes between cases/loops
- Serialize/deserialize efficiently
- Preview resolved snippet expansion dynamically

For instance:

---

## üß† 11. Summary of Your Language So Far

| Category | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Logic** | `<if>`, `<switch>`, `<case>`, `<for>` | Conditional and iterative control |
| **Data Binding** | `<slot>`, `<alias>`, `<choice>` | User input and variable mapping |
| **Functions** | `<fn:...>` | Executable or macro-like snippets |
| **Variables** | `<var>`, `<var-ref>` | Scoped variable management |
| **Extensibility** | Namespaced tags (`fn:`, `sys:`, `usr:`) | Plugin-based expansion |
| **Editing** | AST-driven | Allows semantic code manipulation |

---

## üß© 12. Next Steps

You‚Äôre ready for one of two next concrete steps:

### Option A: LL(2) Recursive Descent Parser Pseudocode

A full breakdown of:

- Tokenizer rules
- Parser functions (for each construct)
- AST builder calls  
	‚úÖ *Good if you‚Äôre ready to start implementing in C#.*

### Option B: Runtime Evaluator + Scoping Model

Covers:

- Variable stack (global/local/function)
- Function resolution
- Loop/switch evaluation
- Alias registry  
	‚úÖ *Good if you want to plan the runtime logic next.*

---

Which one do you want me to do next ‚Äî  
**(A)** the LL(2) parser pseudocode + AST builder,  
or **(B)** the runtime evaluator and variable/scoping design?

---

---

Exactly ‚Äî and you‚Äôre thinking about this the **right way**.  
Designing your snippet language as **HTML-like but logic-aware** gives you **extreme structural flexibility**, while keeping it approachable and easily parsed by an LL(k) parser.  
Let‚Äôs go over how to set up the **architecture, syntax rules, parsing model, runtime evaluation**, and how to prepare the system for **modular extensions, user-defined variables/functions, and large-scale editing** later.

---

## üß± 1. Language Backbone Overview

You‚Äôre essentially building a **Snippet DSL** that:

- Uses **HTML-style tags** for structure and nesting.
- Embeds **logic constructs** (`<if>`, `<for>`, `<switch>`, `<fn:call>`).
- Uses **attribute-style parameters** for readability and extensibility.
- Is **language-agnostic** at the core (you can plug in JS or Python later).

Example syntax:

This lets you support:

- **Dynamic tabstops** (`<tabstop id="1"/>`)
- **Aliases** for readability (`<alias tabstop="1" alias="username"/>`)
- **Logic blocks** (`<if>`, `<switch>`, `<for>`)
- **Custom functions** (`<fn:define>`, `<fn:call>`)
- **Interpolated expressions** (`{expression}` inside text nodes)
- **Composable modules** (user-shared functions/snippets)

---

## üß© 2. LL(k) Parsing Requirements

You only need LL(2) or LL(3) for this.  
Reason: the structure is tag-based and predictable, so the only ambiguity is between:

- Self-closing tags (`<tag />`)
- Nested tags (`<tag>...</tag>`)

### Example Grammar (Simplified)

---

## üå≥ 3. AST Design (Core Nodes)

| Node Type | Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SnippetRoot` | `<snippet>` | Root document |
| `TextNode` | `Hello, world` | Literal text |
| `TagNode` | `<if condition="x">` | General tag container |
| `ExpressionNode` | `{x + 1}` | Inline expression |
| `FnDefineNode` | `<fn:define>` | Defines function |
| `FnCallNode` | `<fn:call>` | Executes function |
| `SwitchNode`, `CaseNode` | `<switch>`, `<case>` | Conditional branches |
| `ForNode` | `<for x in y>` | Loop over collection |
| `VarNode` | `<var name="x" />` | Variable lookup |
| `AliasNode` | `<alias tabstop="1" alias="name" />` | Tabstop alias |

This will allow nested evaluation and AST transformations later (e.g., mass-refactoring, renaming, optimization, etc.).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Runtime Evaluation Model

Once parsed, you‚Äôll need an **evaluator** that walks the AST and executes logic.

### Example Flow

**Evaluation flow:**

1. Look up `users` from the environment (JS context).
2. Iterate each `x`.
3. Evaluate `x.active`.
4. Render the branch if true.

### Execution Context

Maintain a scoped environment (like JS `scope`):

You can implement it using a JS engine like:

- **Jint** (for embedding JS in.NET)
- Or later: **isolated modular runtime**

---

## üß† 5. Modular Extension Model

You want **user-defined modules**, shareable via files or network.

### Structure

Each file defines snippets, functions, or aliases that register into the runtime.

### Example Module Declaration

Modules can be:

- **Loaded dynamically**
- **Scoped (local vs global)**
- **Composable** via `<use module="date-utils" />`

---

## üßÆ 6. Editing Tree for Large-Scale Transformations

Because your snippet is parsed into an AST:

- You can modify **specific nodes** (e.g., all `<case>` elements)
- You can **serialize back to source** (lossless round-trip)
- You can **merge**, **diff**, or **map** large snippet collections

### Example operations:

| Operation | Example | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rename variable | `x ‚Üí user` | Update all occurrences |
| Extract function | Convert inline logic to `<fn:define>` | Improve reuse |
| Inline expansion | Replace `<fn:call>` with body | Useful for flattening |
| Refactor | Move repeated structures to module | Maintainability |

---

## üß© 7. Why JS is a Smart Backbone Choice

| Feature | Benefit |
| --- | --- |
| Dynamic typing | Easier for end users |
| Simple syntax | Low barrier for user extensions |
| Expression support | Perfect for inline `{}` evaluation |
| JSON ecosystem | Natural fit for configuration, state |
| Portable | Can run in browser, desktop, or embedded |

**Implementation in.NET:**  
Use **Jint** (or ClearScript) to host a JS runtime:

- Safe sandboxing
- Load per-user environment
- Predefine context variables

---

## üßÆ 8. Example Unified Snippet

**AST Representation (simplified):**

---

## ‚ö° 9. Pros, Cons, and Mitigations

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structured, human-readable | No HTML templating | Use JSX or React instead |
| Easy LL(k) parsing | Slightly verbose syntax | Add shorthand variants (`<if? condition="x">`) |
| Modular and shareable | Requires runtime context | Lazy-load modules & sandboxes |
| Supports logic & loops | Complex validation | Add schema validation per tag |
| Safe (sandboxable) | Some duplication | Allow aliasing and macros |

---

## üß≠ 10. Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Finalize grammar** (tag syntax, attributes, self-closing rules)
2. üîß **Implement tokenizer** (span-based, position-aware)
3. üß† **Implement LL(2) recursive descent parser**
4. üå≥ **Build AST model**
5. üß© **Add evaluator with JS runtime**
6. üß± **Design modular registry (functions, variables, modules)**
7. üíæ **Add serialization/deserialization (AST ‚Üî source)**
8. üî• **Integrate with editor for live tree updates**

---

Would you like me to write the **grammar and pseudocode** for the LL(2) parser based on your HTML-like snippet syntax (with `<for>`, `<switch>`, `<fn:call>`, etc.) next?  
That would give you a full backbone to start implementing it in C# right away.

---

and i also want the llk parser to create a lsp so that the snippet systems can be appropriately documented, and i want to have a more dynamic than static documentation engine if you get what i mean

---

Yep ‚Äî that makes **perfect sense**.

You‚Äôre essentially describing a **self-documenting snippet language** that integrates into an **LSP (Language Server Protocol)** architecture ‚Äî where your **LL(k) parser** not only parses and validates snippets, but also **feeds metadata into a dynamic documentation and tooling system**.

This gives you IDE-like insight into snippets, variables, functions, and modules ‚Äî all while keeping documentation *live*, *contextual*, and *reflective of the user‚Äôs own customizations*.

Let‚Äôs break it down into a **clear architecture plan** that integrates all these components coherently.

---

## üß© 1. Core Goal Summary

You want:

1. **An LL(k) parser** that builds:
	- An **AST** (for evaluation and editing)
	- A **symbol table / semantic model** (for LSP + docs)
2. **An LSP backend** that:
	- Exposes completions, definitions, references, hover info, etc.
	- Is **driven dynamically** by the user‚Äôs modules, functions, and snippets
3. **A dynamic documentation system** that:
	- Is generated from the AST and symbol table
	- Automatically updates when snippets, modules, or functions change
	- Is queryable (e.g. through a docs panel, command palette, or web UI)
	- Supports **reflection and metadata introspection**

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Parser as the Source of Truth

The LL(k) parser becomes the **semantic compiler** for your language ‚Äî not only producing an AST but also building a **symbol table** that describes every defined element.

### Symbol Table Example

| Symbol Type | Name | Attributes | Source | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Function | greet | params: name | user.fn | global |
| Variable | user | type: object | context | runtime |
| Module | date-utils | version: 1.0 | modules/date-utils.snip | global |
| Snippet | greetUser | aliases, tabstops | greet.snip | global |
| Alias | username | tabstop: 1 | greet.snip | local |

This structure feeds both:

- **LSP capabilities** (auto-completion, hover info, goto definition)
- **Dynamic documentation generation**

---

## üìö 4. Dynamic Documentation Engine

Instead of static Markdown docs, your docs engine is **semantic + reflective**.  
It pulls from the **current parsed state** of snippets and modules.

### Conceptual Design

### Dynamic Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| üîÑ Auto-update | Docs regenerate on file/module change |
| üß≠ Introspective | Shows where symbols are defined/used |
| üìò Structured | Each snippet/function/module becomes a documented entity |
| üí° Live Examples | Evaluated output snippets embedded dynamically |
| üß© Extendable | Users can document custom functions via metadata attributes |

### Example: Auto-generated doc entry

---

## üß† 5. LSP Feature Integration

### 5.1 Completion Provider

- Auto-suggest available tags (`<if>`, `<for>`, `<fn:call>`, etc.)
- Auto-suggest known functions, variables, and aliases
- Context-aware completions (`<case when="...">` inside `<switch>`)

### 5.2 Hover Information

- Shows documentation snippet for hovered tag or function
- Pulls metadata from doc engine or inline doc comments

Example:

### 5.3 Go-To Definition

- Jump to the definition of a function, alias, or snippet in source

### 5.4 Diagnostics

- Reports syntax or semantic errors from parser
- LSP can show inline red squiggles with hints

Example diagnostic:

### 5.5 Signature Help

When typing `params=` inside `<fn:call>`, show parameter list dynamically.

---

## üß© 6. Dynamic Docs vs Static Docs

| Feature | Static Docs | Dynamic Docs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Update mechanism | Manual regeneration | Auto-updates from AST |
| Accuracy | Can desync | Always current |
| User-defined | Hardcoded | Reflects user‚Äôs runtime |
| Context-aware | No | Yes (based on open file/module) |
| Integration | External | Inline (via LSP + UI) |

**Verdict:**  
Dynamic docs are perfect for a snippet engine because your language is *user-extensible*, and static docs would constantly lag behind user modifications.

---

## üß± 7. Implementation Plan (C# + JS Runtime)

| Step | Component | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Tokenizer | Span-based lexer for HTML-like syntax |
| 2 | LL(2) Parser | Builds AST + SymbolTable |
| 3 | Semantic Analyzer | Extracts symbol metadata |
| 4 | LSP Server | Implements hover, completion, diagnostics |
| 5 | Doc Engine | Generates JSON/YAML/HTML docs dynamically |
| 6 | File Watcher | Triggers parser on change for hot reload |
| 7 | JS Runtime (Jint) | Evaluates expressions for examples/docs |

---

## üß© 8. Metadata Extensions for Docs

Allow doc metadata inline (like JSDoc):

Parser can treat these as **DocComment nodes** and feed them directly into the documentation generator and LSP.

---

## üßÆ 9. Pros, Cons, and Mitigations

| Pros | Cons | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unified source of truth | Adds complexity to parser | Modularize semantic extraction |
| Live, accurate docs | Heavier computation | Cache incremental AST changes |
| Great IDE support | Requires JSON-RPC server | Use `OmniSharp` or `Langium` template |
| User-friendly | More setup overhead | Auto-configure via extension manifest |

---

## üß≠ 10. Future Evolutions

Once the LSP and dynamic docs are stable, you can add:

- **Interactive docs**: Execute snippets live in docs (like Jupyter cells)
- **Snip-graph visualizer**: Render dependency graph of functions/snippets
- **Doc search engine**: Fuzzy search all snippets/functions by tag or name
- **Versioned docs**: Keep per-module documentation history

---

Would you like me to outline the **data model and interfaces** for the documentation + LSP integration next?  
(i.e., how to structure `SymbolInfo`, `DocEntry`, `LspProvider`, and `ParserContext` in code terms ‚Äî enough to implement it cleanly in C#.)

---

nah documentation will just be md but with dynamic capabilities to fit contexts etc based off of this convo give me a more organized compilation of my proposed idea

---

Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs compile everything we‚Äôve discussed into a **clean, organized, and technically detailed design summary** of your proposed **HTML-like Snippet Language & Engine with LL(k) Parser, LSP Integration, and Dynamic Markdown Documentation**.

This version keeps everything **coherent, hierarchical, and implementation-oriented**, showing exactly what you‚Äôre building, why it‚Äôs unique, and how it all fits together.

---

## üß† Project Proposal: Advanced Snippet Engine with LL(k) Parser and Dynamic Docs

---

## 1\. üß© Core Concept

You are designing a **next-generation snippet system** inspired by **VSCode snippets**, but:

- **More expressive** ‚Äî supports logic, functions, loops, and user-defined variables.
- **More structured** ‚Äî uses **HTML-like tags** instead of `${}` placeholders.
- **More modular** ‚Äî allows user-defined modules and reusable components.
- **More introspective** ‚Äî supports **LL(k)** parsing, **AST-based editing**, and **LSP** integration.
- **More documented** ‚Äî generates **dynamic Markdown documentation** from parsed definitions.

This makes it not just a snippet manager ‚Äî but a **miniature logic-aware templating language** suitable for code authoring, auto-documentation, and IDE augmentation.

---

## 2\. ‚öôÔ∏è System Architecture Overview

---

## 3\. üß± Snippet Language Overview

### üí° Syntax Philosophy

- **HTML-like tags** ‚Üí simple, nestable, readable.
- **Attribute-driven logic** ‚Üí cleaner and explicit control flow.
- **Self-closing tags** for single-use constructs.
- **Namespaced functions** using `fn:` prefix.

### ‚ú® Example Snippet

---

## 4\. üìú Supported Constructs

| Construct | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `<var>` | `<var name="username" />` | Inserts variable value |
| `<alias>` | `<alias tabstop="1" alias="userName"/>` | Semantic name for tabstop |
| `<tabstop>` | `<tabstop id="1" />` | Insertion point for editor |
| `<choice>` | `<choice id="2" values="yes,no,maybe"/>` | Offers selectable options |
| `<fn:define>` | `<fn:define name="greet">...</fn:define>` | Define reusable function |
| `<fn:call>` | `<fn:call name="greet" params="Cal"/>` | Invoke function |
| `<for>` | `<for x in items>...</for>` | Iterate over collection |
| `<switch>` | `<switch value="x">...</switch>` | Multi-branch logic |
| `<case>` | `<case when="1">...</case>` | Condition in switch |
| `<if>` | `<if condition="x > 1">...</if>` | Conditional rendering |

---

## 5\. üß© Grammar Overview (LL(2))

Simplified EBNF outline for the parser:

- **LL(2)** is sufficient to resolve ambiguities between self-closing and nested tags.
- Expressions within `{}` are evaluated at runtime (via JS).

---

## 6\. üå≥ AST & Symbol Table Model

### AST Nodes

| Node Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SnippetRoot` | Root snippet structure |
| `TagNode` | Generic tag node with name, attributes, and children |
| `TextNode` | Plain text or interpolated text |
| `ExpressionNode` | Inline `{expression}` blocks |
| `FnDefineNode` | Defines reusable snippet functions |
| `FnCallNode` | Executes a defined function |
| `VarNode` | Variable access |
| `AliasNode` | Alias tabstop/variable mapping |
| `ForNode` | Iterative loop |
| `SwitchNode` / `CaseNode` | Branch logic |

### Symbol Table

Holds all declared entities for introspection, LSP, and documentation.

| Symbol | Kind | Scope | Metadata |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| greet | Function | Global | Params: name |
| user | Variable | Global | Type: object |
| tabstop:1 | Tabstop | Local | Aliases: username |
| greetUser | Snippet | Global | Description: "User greeting" |

---

## 7\. ‚öôÔ∏è Runtime and Evaluation

### JS Runtime Integration

Use **Jint** (C#-embedded JS engine) to evaluate:

- Inline expressions (`{x + 1}`)
- Conditional logic
- Function bodies
- Loops and runtime computations

### Scoped Context Example

Evaluation occurs recursively over AST nodes, producing text output or editor transformations.

---

## 8\. üß© Modular System

Snippets and functions can be grouped into **modules**:

Each module:

- Declares its functions/snippets
- Can depend on others via `<use module="name"/>`
- Can be **shared, loaded dynamically**, or **hot-reloaded**

---

## 9\. üß† LSP Integration

The parser powers an **LSP server** to enhance editor experience.

### Supported Features

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Completions | Suggest tags, functions, variables |
| Hover Info | Display doc metadata from dynamic Markdown |
| Go-to Definition | Jump to function/snippet declaration |
| Diagnostics | Syntax and semantic error reporting |
| Signature Help | Show function params inline |
| Rename | AST-safe symbol renaming |
| Refactor | Structural snippet refactoring |

---

## 10\. üìö Documentation System (Dynamic Markdown)

Instead of static docs, documentation is **Markdown-based but dynamic**, generated and updated from the parser + symbol table.

### Example Generated Markdown

**Result:**

```markdown
pgsql
### Dynamic Capabilities
- Auto-updates when functions or snippets change.
- Context-aware (resolves local imports, variables).
- Supports embedded live examples or evaluations.
- Cross-linked (clickable references to functions/modules).

---

Would you like me to follow up with a **specification document structure** (like an RFC / formal language definition document) next ‚Äî outlining how the tag grammar, evaluation model, and metadata schema will be written for developer reference?
```

---

i will also make a custom ide for the engine providing qol features as well as compression and expansion of snippets like regions and all that shit the templating language will also work for snippetting any language, it will be language agnostic not language specific ill also take advantage of the tree structure of parent and child nodes for large scale edits and structural changes which will hopefully shorten dev time and lessen human error ill have to figure out any caveats of using an llk parser over a packrat before development when it comes to syntax development of the language which will essentially be a slightly different form of html/xml tag; will use packrat if its better but not sure that ill need the state handling, but probably wouldnt hurt, just more annoying in development and all that shit i have ideas for forloops, functions, user defined vars, etc, etc, but what else would be helpful either as qol or neglected necessities of snippet engine systems??

---

Excellent ‚Äî you‚Äôre building a **fully-fledged snippet language + IDE + templating platform** that‚Äôs structured, language-agnostic, and capable of programmatic manipulation through its tree model.

You already cover the *core pillars* (parser, AST, runtime, LSP, modularity, docs, and IDE integration).  
So let‚Äôs build on that with **QOL (quality of life)** and **neglected essentials** that most snippet engines overlook ‚Äî features that will make your system more powerful, practical, and pleasant to use.

| **Lazy Node Expansion** | Evaluate only visible or referenced nodes | Ideal for large snippets |
| **Snapshot System** | Save AST versions for undo/redo | Enables structural history |
| **Serialized Intermediate Form (SIF)** | Store compact binary/JSON AST | Fast load/save between sessions |
| **Parallel Parsing Pipelines** | Parse multiple modules asynchronously | Speeds up IDE boot |

## üß© 8. Neglected But Critical Essentials in Snippet Systems

| Neglected Feature | Why It Matters | Implementation Tip |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cross-language Targeting** | Allows one snippet to adapt to JS, Python, C#, etc. | Define `<target>` or template transformers |
| **User Function Registry** | Prevent name collisions and support sandboxed imports | Use `UUID` or scoped namespaces |
| **Security Sandbox** | Prevent malicious code in shared snippets | Limit allowed runtime operations in Jint |
| **Conflict Resolution in Tabstops** | Prevent ID reuse errors | Maintain AST-level tabstop registry |
| **Error Recovery Parsing** | Keep partial parsing during edit | Helps real-time syntax highlighting |
| **Whitespace & Formatting Control** | Predictable formatting post-expansion | Custom pretty printer based on tree |
| **Versioned Snippet Modules** | Allow stable snippet APIs | Use semantic versioning headers |
| **Validation Layer** | Enforce best practices or linting | LSP diagnostics pass |

---

## üí° 9. Optional But High-Yield Additions

| Feature | Why It‚Äôs Worth Adding |
| --- | --- |
| **AST Macros / Node Transform Hooks** ‚Äî Allows auto-rewriting of snippet patterns or shorthand expansions. |  |
| **Inline AI Assistance** ‚Äî Suggest snippet completions based on context (future-proof). |  |
| **AST Query Language** ‚Äî Query snippets via XPath-like syntax (`//fn:define[@name='greet']`). |  |
| **Project Snippet Graph Inspector** ‚Äî Visual UI showing snippet dependencies and usage frequency. |  |
| **Semantic Hotkeys** ‚Äî e.g., `Ctrl+Alt+M` to wrap selected text in `<macro>`. |  |

---

## üß≠ 10. Summary ‚Äî Feature Grouping by Focus Area

| Focus | Key Features | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Parser/Language** | LL(k)/Packrat choice, tag syntax, computed attributes, meta tags | üî¥ Core |
| **Runtime/Evaluation** | Scoped vars, functions, JS eval, error handling | üî¥ Core |
| **Editor/IDE** | Folding, previews, structure view, hot reload | üü° High |
| **Docs/LSP** | Markdown docs, symbol help, completions | üü¢ Medium |
| **Performance** | Incremental parse, caching, async load | üü¢ Medium |
| **Advanced Editing** | AST-based transforms, semantic merge | üü£ Later stage |
| **Ecosystem** | Module registry, snippet marketplace | ‚ö™ Future |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è 11. LL(k) vs Packrat Parser ‚Äî Key Comparison

| Feature | LL(k) | Packrat (PEG) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Predictive Parsing** | Yes (deterministic) | No (backtracking) |
| **Performance** | O(n) if unambiguous | O(n) but higher constant factor |
| **Ease of Grammar Debugging** | Easier to reason about | Can mask ambiguity errors |
| **Error Recovery** | Easier | Harder (due to backtracking) |
| **Context Sensitivity** | Limited | Flexible |
| **Best For** | Structured, predictable grammars (HTML-like) | Dynamic or ambiguous grammars |

‚úÖ **Recommendation:**  
Use **LL(k)** for initial development (simpler, faster, easier debugging).  
If you later introduce advanced syntactic sugar (like optional shorthand, expression interpolation, or context-aware parsing), you can switch to **Packrat (PEG)** or **hybrid LL(k)/PEG** with memoization.

---

Would you like me to follow up by designing a **feature roadmap** for the IDE itself (structured by UX layers, editor components, AST inspectors, and dynamic documentation integration)?  
That would complete your architecture‚Äôs **frontend + backend coherence**.

---

yeah their will also be imports and exports of snippet components; the snippets themselves will be saved/edited/created as snippet modules and imported to/from the project/module level, not the file level computed attributes as well, and yes their will be inline expressions as well as definable codeblock tag, this will just use js, everywhere that there is code in the actual snippet itself will be js only, i cant/wont add all language capabilities event hooks will be good too, but id really rather keep things logic based as opposed to event based, so will probably stick with ifs and switches and other logic tags(all logic tags will be able to be children of both logical and non logical parents if ya get what i mean) yes assertions are a good idea

---

Perfect ‚Äî you‚Äôre locking in a **consistent, logic-first snippet meta-language** with modular extensibility and strong runtime cohesion.  
You‚Äôre avoiding the ‚ÄúDSL sprawl‚Äù problem by **anchoring execution and evaluation exclusively in JS**, while maintaining a declarative logic-layer (tags like `<if>`, `<switch>`, `<for>`, `<assert>`).  
That‚Äôs an extremely smart design ‚Äî it keeps **expressive power high** while **syntactic complexity low**.

Let‚Äôs compile and structure everything we‚Äôve discussed so far into a **coherent and complete design blueprint**, with clear architecture layers, design principles, feature sets, and implementation notes.

---

## üß© Snippet Engine ‚Äî Structured Design Blueprint

---

## üß± 1. Core Concept

A **language-agnostic snippet engine** built on an **LL(k) (or hybrid Packrat) parser**, using **HTML/XML-like tags** to define logical, structural, and variable components of snippets.

Snippets are defined within **modules**, not files.  
Modules can **import/export snippet components**, **define user variables**, **register functions**, and **compose logic trees**.

---

## üß© 2. Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Language Agnostic** | Can template or generate snippets for *any* target language (C#, JS, HTML, etc.). |
| **Logic-Driven** | Controlled by `<if>`, `<switch>`, `<for>`, `<assert>` instead of reactive events. |
| **JS-only Computation** | Any executable expression, function, or code block is JavaScript. |
| **Tree-Based** | Every snippet is represented as a hierarchical tree of nodes (for logic and editing). |
| **Composable** | Snippets are modular, sharable, and composable via imports/exports. |
| **Declarative + Extensible** | Tag-based declarative syntax for logic and flow; extensible via registry. |
| **Dynamic Documentation** | Documentation generated automatically as Markdown, but context-aware. |
| **IDE-integrated** | Custom IDE provides editing, compression/expansion, and dynamic preview. |

This allows:

- Cross-project sharing
- Versioned snippet modules
- Scoped variable/function definitions

---

## üß© 5. Parser & AST Design

### Parsing Strategy:

- **LL(k)** (or hybrid LL(k)/Packrat) for deterministic and recursive structures.
- Grammar mirrors HTML/XML but supports embedded JS `{ ... }` expressions.

### AST Nodes:

| Node Type | Example | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TagNode` | `<for each="x in y">` | Represents structural control flow |
| `ExprNode` | `{x + y}` | Represents inline JS expression |
| `VarNode` | `<var name="n" default="1"/>` | Variable declaration |
| `FnDefineNode` | `<fn:define name="foo">...</fn:define>` | Function definition |
| `ImportNode` | `<import from="core" />` | Module import |
| `MetaNode` | `<meta author="Cal"/>` | Metadata tag |
| `CodeBlockNode` | `<codeblock>...</codeblock>` | Embedded JS |
| `SnippetNode` | `<snippet name="...">...</snippet>` | Root of a snippet definition |

## üß† 8. Advanced Runtime Capabilities

| Capability | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Scoped Variable Registry** | Prevent name collisions between snippets |
| **Context Injection** | Pass global data/context into runtime |
| **Assertions** | `<assert condition="...">` with runtime halting |
| **Hookless Logic** | Prioritize logic tags (`<if>`, `<switch>`) over event-driven callbacks |
| **Dynamic Imports** | Conditional module imports based on runtime logic |
| **Sandboxed JS** | Use Jint with restricted globals for safe evaluation |

---

## üßÆ 9. Dynamic Markdown Documentation

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Generated from Meta + AST** | Markdown built automatically per snippet |
| **Context-Aware** | Renders only relevant parts for current module |
| **Includes Examples** | Can evaluate `<codeblock>` snippets for live examples |
| **Linked References** | Cross-link imported snippets/functions |
| **Auto-versioned** | Version headers in metadata propagate to docs |
| **Exportable** | Docs can be output to static `.md` or live panel in IDE |

---

## üß© 10. Imports / Exports System

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Import** | Load snippets, functions, or variables from external modules |
| **Export** | Make specific snippets or components available to others |
| **Namespaced Imports** | `<import from="ui" as="UI">` ‚Üí `<UI:button/>` |
| **Versioning** | `<import from="core@1.2.3">` |
| **Circular Protection** | Detect and prevent cyclical imports |
| **Dynamic Import Conditions** | `<if condition="{useAdvanced}"><import from="adv"/></if>` |

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è 11. LL(k) vs Packrat ‚Äî Final Decision Points

| Criteria | LL(k) | Packrat (PEG) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Syntax Clarity** | ‚úÖ Simple | ‚ö†Ô∏è Can hide ambiguity |
| **Performance** | ‚úÖ O(n) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Slightly heavier O(n) |
| **Error Recovery** | ‚úÖ Easier | ‚ö†Ô∏è Harder to control |
| **Grammar Complexity** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited lookahead | ‚úÖ Flexible |
| **Best Choice For** | Structured tags | Optional shorthand/interpolation-heavy syntax |

**Verdict:**  
‚Üí Start with **LL(k)** for stability and simplicity.  
‚Üí If expression parsing or mixed constructs become too dynamic, migrate to **hybrid LL(k)/Packrat**.

---

## üí° 12. Potential Future Additions

| Category | Idea | Benefit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Macros / AST Hooks** | User-defined syntax transformations | DSL extensibility |
| **Snippet AI** | Context-based auto-suggestion | Rapid snippet authoring |
| **Semantic Search** | Search by AST shape or tag semantics | Powerful module browsing |
| **AST Query Language** | XPath-like syntax for programmatic snippet ops | Enables advanced refactors |
| **Collaborative Editing** | Multi-user editing of snippet modules | Shared development |

---

Would you like me to compile this into a **technical design document** format next (with sections for Grammar Definition, Runtime Evaluation Flow, and IDE API integration points)?  
That would give you a ready-to-reference master spec before you start development.

---

i want to create this so as to lessen the time it will take for another project to be built as it will require a fuck ton of shit kicking, i want to get a bare minimum project running quickly; so i want all of the snippet features excluding any tree related qols and anything outside of snippet implementation and usage, so <switch "switchable"> <case 1 if="condition" content="content"/> <case 2 if="condition" content={contentValue}/> <switch /> <fn:tabstop#: functionName(param1, param2)/> <for x in y> <tag /> <for/> <choice:tabstop#:|1,2,3|> <alias: tabstop=1 alias="aliasName"/> and mirrors, lambdas, will pretty much do, as well as recursive nesting to nth(llk should deal with that) i want to implement it quickly but with decent quality, ill probably use superpower in c#, or maybe some library in js(it doesnt matter if its not incredibly fast; ill add optimizations later anyway; im ok with using js for conceptual/quick tooling, ill just do it properly later, but i need it relatively quick for another project because there will be many modules/components ill need to make, so consistency as well as a moderate speed will be necessary)

---

Got it ‚Äî you want a **bare-minimum, functional snippet engine** with the **core snippet logic** and **nested variable/function evaluation**, fast enough to bootstrap another project, without extra IDE tooling, tree-based QOL features, or advanced docs. Let‚Äôs structure this clearly as a **minimal implementation plan** with concrete steps.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Minimal Snippet Engine Plan

### Goal:

Rapidly implement a snippet engine capable of handling:

- `<switch>` / `<case>` logic
- `<for>` loops
- `<fn:tabstop#>` function calls
- `<choice>` and `<alias>` tabstops
- Mirrors and lambda-like evaluation
- Recursive nested variables (arbitrary depth)

All implemented **first-pass**, with later optimization possible.

---

## 1\. Language & Runtime Choice

| Option | Pros | Cons | Recommendation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **C# + Superpower** | Strong type safety, easy LL(k) parsing, integrates with.NET tooling | Slower for prototyping, some boilerplate | ‚úÖ Good for robust first version, easier later integration |
| **JS + any parser lib (nearley, chevrotain)** | Very fast prototyping, easier dynamic evaluation | Less type safety, harder large-scale refactors | ‚ö†Ô∏è Quick-and-dirty, can evolve later |

> **Decision:** Use **JS** for **quick prototyping**, especially if you want to bootstrap your project ASAP. Later reimplement in C# with Superpower for performance and structure.

---

## 2\. Core Grammar (LL(k)-style)

Minimal tag-based grammar for parsing snippets:

**Tags Needed Initially:**

- `<switch>` / `<case>`
- `<for>`
- `<fn:tabstop#>`
- `<choice>`
- `<alias>`
- Mirrors and recursive interpolation (`{...}`)

---

## 3\. AST Node Model (Minimal)

| Node | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SwitchNode` | Holds expression and `<case>` children |
| `CaseNode` | Holds condition and content |
| `ForNode` | Iterates over collection |
| `FnTabstopNode` | Represents a function/tabstop |
| `ChoiceNode` | Holds options for tabstop |
| `AliasNode` | Maps tabstop aliases |
| `TextNode` | Plain text or interpolated expressions |
| `ExprNode` | Inline `{}` expression evaluation |

**Note:** Mirrors and recursive nesting handled via `ExprNode` evaluation at runtime.

---

## 4\. Runtime Evaluation Model

1. **Parse** snippet into AST.
2. **Evaluate AST** recursively:
	- `<switch>` ‚Üí evaluate expression, select first `<case>` where `if` is true.
	- `<for>` ‚Üí evaluate iterable, duplicate children for each item.
	- `<fn:tabstop#>` ‚Üí insert dynamic content from function call.
	- `<choice>` ‚Üí store selected option, resolve mirrors/aliases.
	- `{}` expressions ‚Üí evaluated using JS runtime (`eval` or sandboxed VM).
3. **Resolve mirrors recursively** (nth-level nesting allowed).

**Pseudocode (JS style):**

---

## 5\. Implementation Notes

- **Recursive nesting** handled naturally by AST traversal.
- **Mirrors** resolved after evaluation ‚Äî use a **lookup table** for tabstops/aliases.
- **Choice** values stored in context; multiple mirrors of the same tabstop point to same value.
- **JS runtime** handles any inline computation; restrict scope to prevent unsafe code.
- **Module loading**: minimal first-pass can just read snippet files from a folder and parse them; imports/exports can be added later.

---

## 6\. Development Roadmap (Quick MVP)

| Step | Task | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Define grammar and parse `<switch>/<case>`, `<for>` | Build AST |
| 2 | Implement `<fn:tabstop#>` evaluation | Include function param evaluation |
| 3 | Implement `<choice>` + `<alias>` tabstops | Mirrors resolved from alias table |
| 4 | Add recursive `{}` expression evaluation | JS only for MVP |
| 5 | Support nested tags to arbitrary depth | Ensures LL(k) handles recursion |
| 6 | Simple runtime context | Holds tabstops, aliases, variables |
| 7 | Testing & validation | Test nested switch/for/choice combos |

**Optional later improvements:**

- Import/export snippet modules
- Inline `<codeblock>` evaluation
- Dynamic Markdown docs
- IDE/tree-based QOL features

---

## 7\. Performance Considerations

- For MVP, **speed is secondary**; correctness and consistency are priority.
- Later optimizations:
	- Memoize repeated subtrees for mirrors
	- Incremental parsing
	- Precompile frequently used snippets

---

This gives you a **bare-minimum, usable snippet engine** capable of:

- Recursive variable/tabstop resolution
- Basic logic (`switch`, `for`, `<fn:tabstop#>`, `<choice>`, `<alias>`)
- Arbitrary nesting
- Function evaluation (JS-based)
- Mirrors and recursive replacements

All **ready to bootstrap your next project**.

---

If you want, I can **sketch a concrete implementation template in JS or C#** that includes the **parser + AST + runtime evaluator** for exactly this minimal feature set ‚Äî basically a working skeleton that you could plug snippets into immediately.

Do you want me to do that next?

---

yeah there will be a lookup table for mirrors and alias's and all that list best documented llk parser libs for js with pros and cons matrix

---

Here are **some of the best‚Äëdocumented parser libraries in JavaScript** that you could use (or adapt) for your DSL, along with a **pros & cons matrix** to help you decide. Since you‚Äôre aiming for an LL(k)-style parser (or something similar) for your tag‚Äëbased snippet language, I‚Äôve included libraries that support LL or top‚Äëdown parsing, or are at least well‚Äësuited to building one.

---

## üßæ Top Candidate Libraries for JavaScript

| Library | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Chevrotain** | A high‚Äëperformance parser building toolkit for JavaScript, explicitly supports LL(k) grammars. |
| **ll.js** | A simple recursive‚Äëdescent/LL‚Äëstyle parser library in JS. |
| **MiniParse** | A small TypeScript parser‚Äëcombinator/PEG library. While not strictly LL(k), might serve for prototyping. |
| **Peggy** | A parser generator based on PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar). More powerful than pure LL(k). |
| **Nearley** | A JS toolkit using the Earley algorithm (and handles ambiguous grammars) ‚Äî again not purely LL(k), but very flexible. |

---

## üìä Pros & Cons Matrix

Here is a comparative table showing key trade‚Äëoffs:

| Library | Key Strengths | Key Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Chevrotain** | ‚Ä¢ Explicit LL(k) support, well‚Äëdocumented.   ‚Ä¢ High performance for JS.   ‚Ä¢ Good tooling and community support. | ‚Ä¢ Slightly steeper learning curve (defining grammar, tokens, etc.).   ‚Ä¢ More boilerplate than ultra‚Äëminimal libs. |
| **ll.js** | ‚Ä¢ Simple and very quick to get started.   ‚Ä¢ Works in JS with minimal dependencies. | ‚Ä¢ Less mature, fewer features/documentation compared with top libraries.   ‚Ä¢ May lack advanced error recovery or tooling. |
| **MiniParse** | ‚Ä¢ Lightweight TypeScript/JS combinator library.   ‚Ä¢ Good for prototyping.   ‚Ä¢ Modular. | ‚Ä¢ Based on PEG style; not strictly LL(k). May allow back‚Äëtracking, which can complicate performance for large grammars.   ‚Ä¢ Less tailored for LL(k) predictive parsing. |
| **Peggy** | ‚Ä¢ Very expressive grammar syntax (PEG).   ‚Ä¢ Strong error reporting.   ‚Ä¢ Generates parsers you can embed. | ‚Ä¢ PEG is more powerful than LL(k), but also potentially overkill for your controlled DSL.   ‚Ä¢ Might allow grammars that are harder to reason about for performance/ambiguity in your specific case. |
| **Nearley** | ‚Ä¢ Exceptionally flexible (Earley algorithm).   ‚Ä¢ Can handle left recursion and ambiguities.   ‚Ä¢ Good for complex grammars. | ‚Ä¢ Potentially heavier runtime, more complexity than you need for a mostly LL(k) style grammar.   ‚Ä¢ Over‚Äëflexibility may lead to harder debugging for your specific DSL. |

---

## ‚úÖ Recommendation & Fit for Your Project

Given your constraints and goals (rapid MVP, a tag‚Äëbased snippet language, moderate performance acceptable, intending later optimization):

- **Best fit**: **Chevrotain** ‚Äî because it aligns well with LL(k) style, has good documentation, and will give you a solid foundation for your grammar and parser. It may take a little more setup, but it will serve you well for a production‚Äëworthy parser.
- **Quick prototyping**: Use **ll.js** for an ultra‚Äëfast prototype to get your snippet engine working quickly. Then later migrate to Chevrotain for robustness and performance.
- **Avoid over‚Äëengineered**: Libraries like Peggy or Nearley are great, but might be ‚Äútoo much‚Äù for your well‚Äëscoped DSL, and could require you to deal with grammar complexity and ambiguity problems you don‚Äôt need right now.

---

## üõ† Important Considerations Before Picking

- **Grammar complexity**: Ensure your grammar is easily expressed in an LL(k) style (predictive) ‚Äî since you plan nested tags, logic constructs, etc., aim to keep ambiguity low. Traditional LL(k) favours no backtracking.
- **Error recovery & diagnostics**: Good documentation and tools help you catch mistakes early ‚Äî especially beneficial for snippet authors.
- **Performance vs. speed of development**: For MVP you prioritise speed of development; you can optimise later once you validate the design.
- **Tooling support**: Editor integration, grammar debugging, AST output, traceability ‚Äî choose a library with good dev tools or community support.
- **Scalability**: Your snippet language may grow (imports/exports, modules, etc.) ‚Äî choose a library which won‚Äôt become a bottleneck or require a full rewrite later.

---

If you like, I can **collect 5‚Äë10 more JS parser libraries** (with lesser popularity) and create a **ranking** (by ease of use, documentation quality, performance, LL(k)-fit) so you have *backup options*. Would you like me to do that?

---

give me examples of each lib, chevrotain, ll, miniparse

---

Here are example usages of three JavaScript parser libraries‚Äî **Chevrotain**, **ll.js**, and **MiniParse** ‚Äîso you can see how each works in practice. I‚Äôve included basic code snippets and commentary to help you gauge which might fit your snippet‚Äëengine project best.

---

## 1\. Chevrotain

**Library**: Chevrotain ‚Äî a high‚Äëperformance LL(k) parsing toolkit for JavaScript.

### Example usage (JSON parser style)

```js
js// Install: npm install chevrotain
const { CstParser, tokenMatcher, createToken, Lexer } = require("chevrotain");

// 1. Define tokens
const True  = createToken({ name: "True",  pattern: /true/ });
const False = createToken({ name: "False", pattern: /false/ });
const LCurly= createToken({ name: "LCurly", pattern: /{/ });
const RCurly= createToken({ name: "RCurly", pattern: /}/ });
const StringLiteral = createToken({ name: "StringLiteral", pattern: /"([^"]*)"/ });
const Colon = createToken({ name: "Colon", pattern: /:/ });
const Comma = createToken({ name: "Comma", pattern: /,/ });
const WhiteSpace = createToken({ name: "WhiteSpace", pattern: /\s+/, group: Lexer.SKIPPED });

const allTokens = [ WhiteSpace, True, False, LCurly, RCurly, StringLiteral, Colon, Comma ];
const JsonLexer = new Lexer(allTokens);

// 2. Define parser
class JsonParser extends CstParser {
  constructor() {
    super(allTokens);
    const $ = this;

    $.RULE("object", () => {
      $.CONSUME(LCurly);
      $.OPTION(() => {
        $.SUBRULE($.objectItem);
        $.MANY(() => {
          $.CONSUME(Comma);
          $.SUBRULE2($.objectItem);
        });
      });
      $.CONSUME(RCurly);
    });

    $.RULE("objectItem", () => {
      $.CONSUME(StringLiteral);
      $.CONSUME(Colon);
      $.SUBRULE($.value);
    });

    $.RULE("value", () => {
      $.OR([
        { ALT: () => $.CONSUME(StringLiteral) },
        { ALT: () => $.CONSUME(True) },
        { ALT: () => $.CONSUME(False) },
        { ALT: () => $.SUBRULE($.object) }
      ]);
    });

    this.performSelfAnalysis();
  }
}

function parseJson(text) {
  const lexResult = JsonLexer.tokenize(text);
  const parser   = new JsonParser();
  parser.input   = lexResult.tokens;
  const cst      = parser.object();
  if (parser.errors.length) {
    throw Error("Parsing errors detected: " + parser.errors[0].message);
  }
  return cst;
}

// Example:
const result = parseJson('{"a": true, "b": false}');
console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
```

### Commentary

- You define **tokens** (lexer) then a **parser class** with `RULE` methods that describe grammar.
- `performSelfAnalysis()` handles lookahead, analysis, etc.
- Very suitable for LL(k) style, structured grammars, and gives you good control, error reporting, etc.
- **Fit for your snippet‚Äêlanguage**: Yes ‚Äî this gives you a solid foundation for a tag‚Äêbased grammar and nested logic.

---

## 2\. ll.js

**Library**: ll.js ‚Äî simple JS library for recursive‚Äëdescent/LL style parsing.

### Example usage

### Commentary

- Lightweight, good for quick prototyping.
- Grammar is described in a DSL inside JS.
- Might lack some of the advanced tooling, error recovery, and performance guarantees of a full toolkit like Chevrotain.
- **Fit for your snippet‚Äêlanguage**: Possibly ‚Äî great for rapid MVP, especially if you just want something up and running quickly and you‚Äôre OK with simpler error handling.

---

## 3\. MiniParse

**Library**: MiniParse ‚Äî small TypeScript/JavaScript parser‚Äêcombinator library (PEG style) with combinators like `seq()`, `or()`, `repeat()`.

### Example usage

### Commentary

- Parser combinator / PEG style: you build parsers by combining functions rather than defining big grammar classes.
- Backtracking is typical; not strictly LL(k) (which prefers no backtracking) so might introduce ambiguity/performance implications if grammar gets large.
- **Fit for your snippet‚Äêlanguage**: Maybe ‚Äî if you‚Äôre comfortable with combinators and your grammar remains manageable. For your tag‚Äêbased nested language, you might prefer the more structured LL(k) approach, but MiniParse is worth considering for prototyping or simpler subsets.

---

## üìã Summary Table

| Library | Example Complexity | Grammar Style | Good Fit for Snippet Engine |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Chevrotain** | High (token + class + RULEs) | LL(k), structured | ‚úÖ Very good for your full feature set |
| **ll.js** | Medium (DSL grammar + actions) | LL style (recursive descent) | ‚úÖ Good for rapid MVP |
| **MiniParse** | Low‚ÄëMedium (combinators) | PEG / combinator style | ‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable for prototyping, less ideal for large structured grammar |

---

## üéØ Recommendation for You

Since you want a **rapid MVP** but also decent structure:

- If you‚Äôre comfortable investing a little setup now ‚Üí **go with Chevrotain**. You‚Äôll start a bit slower, but you'll have a strong foundation and less refactoring later.
- If you want to *just get something working quickly* (and plan to rework later) ‚Üí **choose ll.js** or **MiniParse** for the MVP, then consider migrating.
- For your tag‚Äêbased snippet language with nesting, logic tags, etc., I lean **Chevrotain** as the best long‚Äêterm choice.

---

If you like, I can pull **code‚Äêskeletons** for each of these three‚Äîbut tailored to your *snippet language syntax* (tag‚Äêbased grammar) ‚Äî so you see side‚Äêby‚Äêside how your grammar might be expressed in each library. Would that be helpful?

---

ill probably just use c# and superpower, surprisingly more straightforward, give me an example in the context of my proposed snippet lang

---

Perfect ‚Äî Superpower in C# is actually **very straightforward for a tag-based DSL**, and it will give you type safety, easy AST construction, and good parsing performance without having to worry about dynamic JS evaluation for your MVP. I‚Äôll give a **full example** for your **core snippet features**: `<switch>`, `<case>`, `<for>`, `<fn:tabstop#>`, `<choice>`, `<alias>`, mirrors, and recursive nesting.

---

## 1\. Install Superpower

---

## 2\. Define Tokens

---

## 3\. Tokenizer

> This tokenizer can now handle your HTML-like tags, inline JS-style expressions, and literal text.

---

## 4\. AST Node Models

```csharp
csharppublic abstract class SnippetNode {}

public class TextNode : SnippetNode
{

Great. I‚Äôll research how to build an LL(k)-style parser using C# and Superpower for your custom snippet language that resembles an HTML/XML tag structure, including constructs like `<switch>`, `<for>`, `<fn:tabstop#>`, and more. I‚Äôll include best practices for function/variable registration and evaluation, and approaches for runtime expression execution (e.g., with ClearScript or similar). The goal will be to generate compiled outputs in target languages from snippet-based source files.

I‚Äôll let you know when everything is ready for review.

LL(k) Snippet Engine in C# Using Superpower with Runtime Scripting

## Designing the DSL Grammar and Parser

To parse a custom snippet DSL like the one shown, first define a formal grammar and implement a parser. A practical approach is to design it as an LL(1) (recursive-descent) grammar. For example, treat tags like `<switch>`, `<case>`, `<for>` etc. as tokens and define production rules for nested tags and attributes. In Superpower, you would write a *tokenizer* for symbols (`<`, `>`, `/`, identifiers, string literals, etc.) and then use parser combinators to build higher-level parsers. The Superpower library supports token-based parsing with good error-reporting; its GitHub repo even lists example grammars (e.g. a complete JSON parser) that illustrate building a full grammar from tokens. In practice, **build the parser incrementally**: start by parsing simple constructs (like a single tag or attribute) and test each piece before combining them into the full grammar.

Key steps include:

- **Tokenize the syntax.** Define token kinds for angle brackets, tag names, attribute names/values, text content, etc. For example, tokens for `<`, `>`, identifiers (`switch`, `case`, etc.), string literals, and special markers (`{` ‚Ä¶ `}`) can be created in Superpower.
- **Parse tag structure.** Using these tokens, write parsers for each construct. For instance, a `<switch>` parser that reads `<switch ...>` followed by one or more `<case>` blocks, and a closing `</switch>`. Similarly handle `<for>` ‚Ä¶ `</for>`, `<choice:...>` tags, and self-closing tags (like `<tag/>`).
- **Handle expressions and content.** Within attributes or content (e.g. `if="condition"` or `{contentValue}`), you can either treat them as raw strings to be evaluated later, or further parse them if they follow an expression grammar. Superpower lets you embed sub-parsers for attribute expressions if needed.
- **Avoid left-recursion.** Ensure your grammar is LL(1) by eliminating left-recursive rules and factoring alternatives where necessary. Superpower (like other recursive-descent approaches) handles LL grammars well, but not direct left recursion.

By incrementally composing these parsers and testing against sample snippet inputs, you can validate your DSL structure. For reference, the Superpower repository‚Äôs examples (e.g. the JSON parser) show how to turn a list of token types into a working parser.

## Using Superpower to Parse XML/HTML-like DSLs

Superpower excels at token-based parsing. You would typically start with something like:

Then build parsers (using `Parse.Token` and combinators) for each tag:

- A **switch** parser: looks for `<switch ...>` then many `<case>` children, then `</switch>`.
- A **case** parser: reads `<case`, an index, optional `if` attribute, `content`, then `/>` or `</case>`.
- A **for** loop parser: `<for x in y>` ‚Ä¶ `</for>`.
- A generic tag parser for `<tag />`, `<tag>...</tag>`.
- And so on (functions and choices can be similar tokens or expressions).

Each parser returns an AST node (e.g. `SwitchNode`, `CaseNode`, `ForNode`, etc.). As Nicholas Blumhardt recommends, build and test **each sub-parser on representative input chunks** before combining them. Superpower‚Äôs composability means you can, for instance, parse an identifier (`Character.Letter.AtLeastOnce()`), or a sequence (`from x in ... select ...`), and compose them into complex rules.

*Example:* Superpower‚Äôs repo lists a `JsonParser` as a ‚Äúcomplete, annotated example‚Äù of a full language grammar. While JSON isn‚Äôt XML-like, it shows how to define tokens and combinators. Similarly, you can use `Parse.Token(SnippetToken.OpenAngle)`, then `Parse.Token(SnippetToken.Identifier)`, etc., with `.Then()` or LINQ syntax to assemble your grammar.

## Functions, Variables, and Symbol Tables

Your DSL supports custom functions (`<fn:tabstop#:`) and user variables. A clean design is to separate parsing from execution: first build an AST of nodes (representing operations like function calls, loops, conditional switches, etc.), and then evaluate or translate that AST. In the evaluator stage, maintain a **symbol table** (e.g. a `Dictionary<string, object>`) for variables and function references. This is the standard pattern for DSLs: ‚ÄúThe simplest \[symbol table\] is a key:value store. In your visitor, add var declarations as encountered, and read out the values as var references are encountered‚Äù. If your DSL has scoped variables (e.g. variables local to a loop), you can implement scope by pushing and popping a stack of dictionaries.

For functions, you might register each function name to a delegate or a handler. For example, you could have `Dictionary<string, Func<Context, IList<object>, object>>` where the key is the function name (like `functionName` from your `<fn:‚Ä¶>` tag) and the value is a C# method that takes a list of parameter values and returns a result. During parsing or initialization, load user-defined functions into this registry. Then when evaluating a function call node, look up the function by name and invoke it. This mirrors how built-in snippet engines or template languages let you bind host functions into the DSL.

In short: **register variables and functions in lookup tables at runtime**, and during AST evaluation, resolve names via that table. If you needed, say, a `<set name="x" value="10"/>` tag, you would parse it and then at execution do something like `context.Variables["x"] = 10`. This follows best practice of using a symbol table for identifiers.

## Runtime Evaluation: Scripting vs Compilation

For the runtime behavior, you have several approaches:

- **Embedded Scripting Engines:** You can host a scripting engine inside your C# app to evaluate expressions or scripts. For example, ClearScript allows you to embed V8 (JavaScript) or VBScript. ClearScript ‚Äúlets you add scripting capabilities to a.NET application‚Ä¶ you can pass JavaScript or VBScript expressions to the engine and they‚Äôll be processed and run. Interestingly, you aren‚Äôt limited to using plain script objects‚Ä¶ you can integrate external JavaScript libraries and script-managed.NET objects‚Äù. This means you could translate parts of your DSL into a JS snippet and run it with ClearScript, passing in your function/variable context as host objects.
- **.NET Dynamic Languages:** The Microsoft Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) supports languages like IronPython, IronRuby, or even embedding Lua. One StackOverflow answer notes: ‚Äúconsider a language that is specifically built for scripting, such as IronRuby, IronPython, or Lua. IronPython and IronRuby are both available today‚Äù. These can be hosted in your app, letting users write snippets in Python or Lua which you then execute. For example, IronPython can execute Python code with access to.NET objects. (There are guides on embedding IronPython as well.) Lua via LuaInterface or NLua is another option.
- **Dedicated Scripting Frameworks:** There are.NET libraries like Boo or Script#. As one answer notes, ‚ÄúBoo (which has an interpreter) or Script.NET ‚Ä¶ Boo makes a nice scripting language, \[with\] flexible syntax‚Ä¶ Script.NET ‚Ä¶ is open source‚Ä¶ uses a friendly compiler generator (Irony)‚Äù. Boo can compile scripts or interpret them on the fly. Script.NET (S#) is an open project you can extend.
- **C# Compilation (CodeDOM / Roslyn):** You can compile C# code at runtime. For example, use the Roslyn Scripting API (`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.Scripting`) to compile and execute C# code in-memory, or use `CSharpCodeProvider` /CodeDOM to emit a dynamic assembly. This has the advantage of using full C# syntax. Just be careful: compiled code typically requires an AppDomain (or `AssemblyLoadContext`) if you want to unload/reload code. As one comment suggests: ‚ÄúUse C# and compile it with the C# code provider. As long as you load it in its own AppDomain, you can load and unload it to your heart‚Äôs content‚Äù. Alternatively, you could compile all snippet-related code into one assembly and reload it as needed.

**Summary of approaches:**

- *Lightweight Scripting:* Use ClearScript for JavaScript or IronPython for Python; register your variables/functions as host objects.
- *Roslyn/CodeDOM:* If you prefer C#, generate C# code (either from your DSL or directly) and compile it.
- *Language APIs:* Use existing DSL frameworks (Boo, Lua, Script.NET) if they align with your needs.

Cite examples: one answer specifically mentions embedding PowerShell as well (for hosting script in.NET), and points to guides.

## Interpreting vs. Generating Code

Decide whether the snippet engine should *interpret* DSL at runtime or *emit code* for another build step. The user notes wanting ‚Äúinitial source files‚Äù separate from snippet definitions, and ‚Äúseparate compiled outputs of target language.‚Äù This suggests a code-generation approach: the DSL is processed (at build time or tool-time) and produces target-language source files.

In that model, you parse the DSL into an AST and then traverse it to **generate source code**. For example, a `<for>` tag might output a `for(...) { ... }` loop in the target language. As one StackOverflow answer puts it, after parsing you can either ‚Äúgenerate a parse tree structure, and generate‚Ä¶ code from that, or‚Ä¶ generate code on the fly‚Äù. In practice, building an AST first (option 1) is cleaner: you separate syntax parsing from code emission. Then you can pretty-print or serialize the AST into target code. This fits use-cases like templating or snippet expansion where the DSL is essentially a macro-language for code.

Alternatively, a pure *interpreter* would evaluate the DSL structure at runtime (perhaps directly manipulating the program state). That might be useful if snippets should have dynamic behavior. But given the requirement of ‚Äúseparate compiled outputs,‚Äù a generator that emits source files (or injection into existing files) is likely intended.

## Best Practices and Resources

- **Incremental Development:** Build and test parsers piece by piece. As noted, ‚Äúbuild up the parser incrementally, testing each smaller parser on chunks of input‚Äù. Don‚Äôt try to parse the whole DSL at once. Start with tokenizing a tag, then parsing a single element, then add nesting, conditions, etc.
- **Error Handling:** Superpower provides good error messages by default. Define your token kinds clearly so that parse errors can identify unexpected tokens (Superpower‚Äôs token-based approach yields meaningful ‚Äúunexpected identifier‚Äù errors rather than raw character mismatches).
- **Separate Concerns:** Keep parsing, evaluation, and code-generation stages separate. The parser builds a tree; a separate component handles execution or generation. This makes testing easier and helps manage complexity.
- **Function/Variable Registration:** Provide a clear API for registering custom functions or initial variables before evaluation. For instance, you might have `snippetEngine.RegisterFunction("foo", args => { ... });` and `snippetEngine.SetVariable("bar", 42);` so that snippet code can refer to `foo()` or `$bar`.
- **Citing Examples:** For Superpower-specific guidance, consult the library‚Äôs GitHub and docs. The Superpower README and blog give an introduction, and the examples (JSONParser, IntCalc, etc.) show how to parse expressions. There aren‚Äôt many tutorials on XML-like grammars with Superpower specifically, but you can adapt HTML/XML parsing strategies (define tokens for tags and text). The principles are the same as parsing any nested language.

In summary, use Superpower‚Äôs token/parser combinators to implement your custom DSL grammar, maintain symbol tables for variables/functions (key-value stores as recommended), and choose an evaluation strategy that fits your scenario (scripting engine vs. code emission). By following standard parsing practices and leveraging these tools, you can build a ‚Äúsuped-up‚Äù snippet engine with the flexibility you need.

C# Superpower Snippet Engine with Full Tag Support and Runtime Evaluation

## Custom Snippet Grammar and Parser with Superpower

To parse a custom XML-like snippet DSL (with tags like `<switch>`, `<case>`, `<for>`, `<fn:.../>`, `<choice:...>`, `<alias:.../>`, `<if>`, `<else>`, `<mirror>`, etc.), we can follow a **two-step** approach as recommended by Superpower. First, we define a **tokenizer** to split the input into tokens (identifiers, strings, numbers, punctuation, etc.), then build a **parser** with combinators to produce an AST. We also prepare AST node classes and a runtime interpreter that implements the *Interpreter* pattern (each node has an `Evaluate` method). Finally, we integrate an embedded script engine (ClearScript) for evaluating expressions or calling JavaScript functions at runtime.

## Tokenizer: Identifying Tokens

First, we define token kinds and a tokenizer. We identify tokens for markup syntax (`<`, `>`, `/`, `=`, `:`, `(`, `)`, `,`), identifiers, numbers, string literals, expressions in braces, choice-lists, and plain text. For example:

We can build the tokenizer with `TokenizerBuilder<T>`. For brevity, here is a representative setup:

> **Note:** We include whitespace as part of `Text` content (so we do **not** call `.Ignore(Span.WhiteSpace)`), to preserve spacing in plain text nodes. This tokenizer will break the snippet source into tokens like `TokenKind.LAngle`, `TokenKind.Identifier("switch")`, `TokenKind.String("\"varName\"")`, etc. This follows the Superpower pattern of *first tokenizing, then parsing*.

## AST Classes

We define an AST hierarchy where each snippet construct has a corresponding node class. Every node implements a common interface (e.g. `Evaluate(Context)`) per the *Interpreter pattern*. For example:

```csharp
csharpabstract class SnippetNode
{
    public abstract string Evaluate(Context ctx);
}

/// <summary>Plain text node</summary>
class TextNode : SnippetNode
{
    public string Text { get; }
    public TextNode(string text) { Text = text; }
    public override string Evaluate(Context ctx) => Text;
}

/// <summary><switch> ... </switch> node</summary>
class SwitchNode : SnippetNode
{
    public string Expression { get; }
    public List<CaseNode> Cases { get; } = new();
    public SnippetNode? DefaultBranch { get; set; }
    public SwitchNode(string expr) { Expression = expr; }
    public override string Evaluate(Context ctx)
    {
        // Evaluate the switch expression (could use ClearScript or a lookup)
        var value = ctx.EvaluateExpression(Expression);
        foreach (var c in Cases)
        {
            if (c.IsMatch(ctx, value))
                return c.Evaluate(ctx);
        }
        return DefaultBranch?.Evaluate(ctx) ?? "";
    }
}

/// <summary><case> node inside <switch></summary>
class CaseNode : SnippetNode
{
    public string? Condition { get; }  // e.g. condition expression
    public List<SnippetNode> Body { get; } = new();
    public bool IsMatch(Context ctx, object switchValue)
    {
        // Check numeric or string condition, or always true if no condition
        if (Condition == null) return true;
        // For simplicity, treat Condition as an expression to eval
        var condVal = ctx.EvaluateExpression(Condition);
        return Equals(switchValue, condVal);
    }
    public override string Evaluate(Context ctx)
    {
        // Join all child nodes' evaluations
        return string.Concat(Body.Select(node => node.Evaluate(ctx)));
    }

Each node‚Äôs `Evaluate` method uses the **Context** (runtime state) to look up variables, call functions, or evaluate expressions. This follows the Interpreter pattern: each node ‚Äúknows‚Äù how to evaluate itself in context. For example, `ForNode` iterates over a collection in the context, pushing a new scope for each loop iteration. `IfNode` evaluates its condition (possibly using ClearScript) and chooses the true/false branch. `FunctionNode` looks up a delegate or uses the script engine to compute the result.

## Parser with Superpower

Using the tokens above, we build `TokenListParser<TokenKind, SnippetNode>` combinators to parse tags and build the AST. We can compose smaller parsers for each construct. For example, a simplified parser for `<switch>` might look like:

```csharp
csharp// Parser for quoted string or identifier (tag contents, expressions, etc.)
static TokenListParser<TokenKind, string> QuotedString =
    Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.String).Apply(Numerics.Compact.Expression).Select(n => n.ToString());

// <case number if="cond" content={val}/> parser
static TokenListParser<TokenKind, CaseNode> CaseParser =
    from _1    in Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.LAngle)
    from caseW in Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.Identifier).Where(t => t.ToStringValue() == "case")
    from idx   in Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.Number).Apply(Numerics.IntegerInt32) // case index
    from _2    in Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.Identifier).Where(t => t.ToStringValue() == "if")
    from _eq   in Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.Equals)
    from cond  in Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.String).Select(t => t.ToStringValue().Trim('"'))
    from _3    in Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.Identifier).Where(t => t.ToStringValue() == "content")
    from _4    in Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.Equals)
    from expr  in Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.Expression).Select(t => t.ToStringValue().Trim('{', '}'))
    from _5    in Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.Slash)
    from _6    in Token.EqualTo(TokenKind.RAngle)
    select new CaseNode { Condition = cond, Body = { new TextNode(expr) } };
```

For brevity, here‚Äôs a conceptual outline of the parser combinators (fully fleshing them out would be lengthy):

- **SwitchParser:** Recognizes `<switch "expr"> ... </switch>`.
- **ForParser:** Parses `<for x in list> ... </for>` by recognizing the loop variable and collection.
- **FunctionParser:** Parses `<fn:tabstop#: funcName(arg1, arg2) />`.
- **ChoiceParser:** Parses `<choice:tabstop#:|opt1,opt2|>` by splitting the `| |` content into options.
- **AliasParser:** Parses `<alias: tabstop=1 alias="foo"/>` (extracting tabstop number and alias name).
- **IfParser/ElseParser:** Parses `<if condition="cond"> ... <else/> ... </if>` with true/false branches.
- **MirrorParser:** Parses `<mirror name="foo"/>`.

Finally, a **root parser** ties text and tags together, for example:

This way, the parser processes the entire snippet source into a list of `SnippetNode` AST elements. (The above outlines would be implemented in C# using Superpower‚Äôs LINQ-style combinators ‚Äì see e.g. \[3\] for a step-by-step guide on building a parser via tokens.)

## Runtime Context and Evaluation

At runtime, we maintain a **Context** object that holds variable scopes and registered functions. For example:

```csharp
csharpclass Context
{
    private readonly Stack<Dictionary<string, object>> scopes = new();
    public Dictionary<string, Delegate> Functions { get; } = new();
    public V8ScriptEngine ScriptEngine { get; }

    public Context()
    {
        scopes.Push(new Dictionary<string, object>());
        ScriptEngine = new V8ScriptEngine();
        // Expose the context to scripts if needed
        ScriptEngine.AddHostObject("ctx", this);
    }

    public void PushScope() => scopes.Push(new Dictionary<string, object>());
    public void PopScope() => scopes.Pop();
    public void SetVariable(string name, object value) => scopes.Peek()[name] = value;
    public object? GetVariable(string name)
    {
        foreach (var scope in scopes) if (scope.TryGetValue(name, out var val)) return val;
        return null;
    }
    public bool TryGetVariable(string name, out object? value) => 
        (value = GetVariable(name)) != null;

    public object EvaluateExpression(string expr)
    {
        // Use ClearScript to evaluate the expression (JS) in context of variables
        ScriptEngine.Script.vars = new HostTypeCollection("mscorlib", "System.Core");
        foreach (var kv in scopes.Peek())
            ScriptEngine.Script[kv.Key] = kv.Value;
        return ScriptEngine.Evaluate(expr) ?? "";
    }

    // Helper for ClearScript invocation
    public object EvaluateScript(string code)
    {
        // e.g. using V8ScriptEngine from ClearScript
        return ScriptEngine.Evaluate(code) ?? "";
    }
}
```
- **Variables:** We manage a stack of dictionaries for lexical scope. On a `<for>` loop or entering a function, we `PushScope()`, assign variables, then `PopScope()` after. This matches best practice of mapping names to values in an environment.
- **Functions:** We allow registering C# methods as delegates in `Context.Functions`. For example, to register a function `PrintNumber(int)`, we could do:
	In JavaScript (via ClearScript), we expose it by adding a host object or host function, e.g.:
- **Expressions and conditions:** We evaluate conditions or expressions using ClearScript‚Äôs engine (`V8ScriptEngine`). This allows full JavaScript (or even C# via ClearScript) semantics for inline code. The ClearScript documentation notes that ‚Äúyou can pass JavaScript or VBScript expressions to the engine and they‚Äôll be processed and run‚Äù. For instance, an `<if>` tag with `condition="x > 5"` would call `EvaluateExpression("x > 5")`.

This design lets us mix static snippet AST with dynamic evaluation. We **register custom functions** by name (mapping to `Delegate` or host objects), and users can also write JS expressions or functions inline. The example from StackOverflow shows adding a static C# method to ClearScript via `AddHostObject`, which we mirror by exposing our `Context` or individual functions.

## Putting It All Together

In practice, you would tie the above components as follows:

1. **Tokenize** the snippet text: `var tokens = tokenizer.Tokenize(sourceText)`.
2. **Parse** into AST: `var ast = DocumentParser.Parse(tokens)`, giving a list of `SnippetNode`.
3. **Set up context**: create `Context ctx = new Context();` register any built-in functions or initial variables (e.g. from your application).
4. **Evaluate**: concatenate all nodes‚Äô evaluations:

Each `Evaluate` call resolves tags, runs loops, conditions, or calls functions as implemented. For example, a `<switch>` node iterates through its `<case>` children and returns the first match. A `<for>` node repeats its body. `<fn:.../>` nodes invoke C# or JS functions (using `Context.Functions` or ClearScript). This meets the requirement for a **runtime interpreter** that produces target code output, similar to VSCode snippet expansion but fully customizable.

Throughout the implementation, we follow **best practices**: define a clear grammar and tokenizer first, use small reusable parser combinators for each construct, model evaluation with the Interpreter pattern, and register functions/variables in a controlled context. When needed, we leverage ClearScript to evaluate embedded expressions or user-defined scripts. This structure yields a maintainable snippet engine that can be extended with additional tags or runtime features as required.

**Sources:** We drew on Superpower examples (tokenizer and combinators), interpreter design guidance, and ClearScript integration patterns to inform this design. These practices ensure robust parsing, clear AST modeling, and flexible runtime execution.
